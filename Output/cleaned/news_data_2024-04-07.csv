 the us securities and exchange commission sec  paused the implementation of its climate disclosure requirements for companies as legal challenges against the rules are pending in a circuit court 
 
 in march the sec  finalized  a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climaterelated risks to their business the secs final rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much co is emitted from their operations this led to several republican states companies and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations asking for the sec rule to be stayed two energy companiesliberty energy inc and nomad proppant services llcsought an administrative stay on the rule which was granted by the fifth circuit court on march  
 according to sec rules businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events 
 other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the second sixth eighth eleventh and dc circuit courts all the lawsuits including the fifth circuit one were consolidated into a single case with the eight circuit set to hear the  challenge  
 on march  the chamber of commerce of the united states of america the texas association of business and the longview chamber of commerce filed a motion in the eighth circuit seeking a stay of the sec rules pending judicial review 
 challenging sec 
 lawsuits from republican states  claim  that the sec breached their rulemaking authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from congress 
 secs rules create costly unnecessary red tape for businesses  they accused the climate rules of being part of the biden administrations push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns 
 on april  sec secretary vanessa countryman issued an  order  staying the agencys climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the eighth circuit 
 ms countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules the secs stay will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges 
 in addition a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the final rules requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity 
 though the sec is issuing a stay on the climate rule the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are consistent with applicable law and within the authority of the commission the order stated 
 thus the commission will continue vigorously defending the final rules validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation 
 outrageous climate mandate 
 iowa attorney general brenna bird one of the republican ags that led  states to file lawsuits against the climate rules called the secs april  stay a victory that shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since biden took office 
 the secs job is to protect people from fraud it has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates we are making it clear that biden has to follow the law like everyone else  she said 
 by halting this mandate we are protecting businesses from costly red tape securing our supply chain and defending family farms next we are going to make this win permanent 
 in addition to iowa other states in the lawsuit are alabama alaska arkansas georgia idaho indiana kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri montana nebraska new hampshire north dakota ohio oklahoma south carolina south dakota tennessee texas utah virginia west virginia and wyoming 
 the sec rule will also require businesses to disclose climaterelated risks including higher insurance rates from weather disasters and release a plan to adapt to climateagenda recommendations  the plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year  
 sec votes 
 when the sec finalized its climate rules in march agency commissioners had voted  to pass the measure the votes were done along party lines with all democrats voting in favor of the rule and republican commissioners voting against it 
 republican commissioner hester peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors 
 however wellintentioned these particularized interests dont justify forcing investors who dont share them to foot the bill  he said  the sec estimates the climate rule to impact around  american firms 
 the rules adopted in march were a watereddown version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions these stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community 
 in an interview with  the epoch times  in june  sean griffith a professor at fordham university school of law suggested that sec rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earths climate is being affected by human actions 
 the reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either theyre politically drivenwhich is very plausibleor they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those esg portfolios at the end of the day its not about investors

 thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of  a year when more than seventy nations will have elections which often means massive increases in government spending  additionally the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth 
 in the united states headline pce inflation in february will likely grow by  compared with a  rise in january and consensus expects a  annualized rate up from  in january this is on top of the already  accumulated inflation of the past four years core inflation will likely show a  gain according to bloomberg economics which means an annualized  building on top of the price increases of the past years 
 thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its  lows 
 central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in  and now they are again easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished  
 furthermore the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates because different parallel measures of money growth including reverse repo liquidity injections have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the g central banks was moderating albeit at a slower pace than announced 
 cutting rates may come too late because by the time it is implemented it will cause a double negative 
 government deficits will be cheaper to refinance bloating an already recordhigh public debt yet again but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation which means weaker margins more difficulties to make ends meet and impoverishment 
 we must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index  we certainly know one thing consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power and everyone from europeans to americans knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in  
 nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation furthermore the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast 
 
 the fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring  additionally it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk there has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy small businesses and families since the us government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases as such the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets everyone else will be hurt both ways with inflation and lower access to credit 
 you may think all the above problems are policy mistakes but they are not this is a slow process of nationalizing resources  inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government you are basically becoming poorer to sustain an everincreasing government size the next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services the mistakes made in  will cost the middle class many more taxes even if the government promises it will only be taxes on the rich the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes

Explosion In Gold Shows Investors Are Preparing For The Endgame
"via schiffgoldcom 
 with gold hitting yet another aweinspiring alltime high in the wake of powells remarks reassuring markets more or less to expect rate cuts in   a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction  so is there really still room to run 
 
 the  wall street journal  points out that  oil price spikes  driven by the acceleration of war in the middle east  could cause the fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times  this year   especially as the strategic petroleum reserve has reached historic lows 
 since biden took office the spr has been drained by over   ironically as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in ukraine and outofcontrol inflation which can only get even worse after the fed cuts rates now that  the spr wont be refilled as expected  itself a taxpayerfunded sale  americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps 
 for context the spr was founded in  and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early s

 but as the conflict in gaza and beyond continues to accelerate the us will find more excuses to  expand its own involvement  as it has from the start  
 whatever form the meddling takes the us will inevitably need to finance it by printing money so as usual the fed is damned if they do and damned if they dont defeated by their own games they need to finance the middle east meddling with money printing but both the money printing required to fund the war  and  the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up 
 coincidentally both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh alltime highs this year  unless the fed decides to buck the militaryindustrial complex and renege on its rate cut promises making it much more challenging for biden administration war hawks to keep the us involved to the extent theyd like 
 on the same topic of russia and the middle east the brics countries continuing dedollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to  keep stockpiling gold  as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence  russia says theyll be  doubling  their gold  and foreign currency purchases and chinas central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month 
 still some are skeptical saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction and interpreted powells remarks on wednesday as mildly hawkish  powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the fed to move forward with rate cuts these statements added a dash of uncertainty for some 
 
 we do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards  percentreducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to  percent 
 
 but even as powell admitted the fight against inflation is not done  an epic understatement   markets were reassured that the fed is still expecting to lower interest rates saying that the data doesnt justify changing the current course 
 
 the recent data do not however materially change the overall picture which continues to be one of solid growth a strong but rebalancing labor market and inflation moving down toward  percent on a sometimes bumpy path 
 
 so is gold too overbought or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running 
 while shortterm corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic pricerun ups id call them buying opportunities  
 and if the mainstream medias reaction is to be used as a barometer the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the us dollar still hasnt been priced in as peter schiff tweeted earlier this week 
 
 the mainstream media has finally noticed  gold  but has no idea why its rising or has any appreciation for how high its going theyre also not encouraging anyone to buy it all of this is a good sign that the rally still has a long way to go before any meaningful correction

"abandoning petrolburning vehicles and adopting lowcarbon technologies to power tomorrows economy are trends accelerating across the nation to do this access to rare earth metals key ingredients in many of these green technologies must be sourced domestically  not from china an emerging national security threat to the us as the world fractures into a multipolar state there is a big push domestically to revive americas metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on asia  
 morgan stanley analyst carlos de alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the us metals and mining sector to clients he highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades he believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit  
 
 us reliance on import critical minerals has reached a year high and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades the analyst said pointing out americas heavy reliance on imported minerals from china 
 
 the us government has identified  minerals it deems critical to the us economy and to national security for  of those critical minerals more than  of domestic consumption depends on imports  
 
 
 since  the us has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports in  the us was fully reliant on imports for the supply of  minerals and imports exceeded  of consumption for  minerals including all minerals not only critical ones 
  these figures have risen to  and  respectively as of  china currently dominates the global mineral processingrefining industry and the us is heavily reliant on china  of net import reliance for imports of  minerals  
 
 chinas global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat were western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last threeplus decades to allow this to happen  
 the analyst detailed how china dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in us mineral supply chains especially given the ongoing tensions in sinous relations 
 
 china is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions for us policymakers the uss mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the us mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains in addition the us faces a multidecade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry which has fallen from  of gdp in  and a peak of  in  to just  today 
 
 after being asleep at the wheel for decades the bloated us government thank former president trump  has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious catchup game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild americas domestic mining and separation sector  
 
 us permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply the analyst said 
 he said the big winner of permitting reform that is geared toward promoting the development of mining projects will be the junior mining and exploration industry  
 one company that stands to benefit is mp materials the largest usbased miner of rare earths the analyst said this company is a play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines  
 he continued 
 
 the companys mission is to restore the full us rare earth supply chain mp has executed on its plan of restarting the mountain pass mine in california and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides the company will get into the production of ndfeb alloy flake and permanent magnets critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines with a plant that is under construction in texas  
 
 shares of mp materials have roundtripped covid lows  
 
 he said clevelandcliffs inc and united states steel corporation are key beneficiaries to building exchina supply chains given clf is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the us and x is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year  
 he added all steel names under our coverage nue stld clf and x will broadly benefit from reshoring trends given manufacturing facilities and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive  
 and the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the us that should interest investors 
 
 american rare earths ltd arrax  market cap a million  arr is a rare earth exploration  development company their  owned flagship project halleck creek deposit is located in wyoming and has extensive rare earth mineralization according to the company the project has the potential to be amongst the largest rare earth deposits in the us 
 
 
 usa rare earth private  according to usa rare earth the company owns the only scalable sintered neomagnet manufacturing system in the western hemisphere located in oklahoma the company is targeting magnet production in  and is aiming to supply the plant with rare earth feed stock mined from the round top property in texas in late  or early  usa rare earth owns an  stake in the round top property texas mineral resources otcbq tmrc owns the remaining  stake 
 
 
 perpetua resources pptato  market cap c million  perpetuas flagship development project is the stibnite gold project located in idaho which according to the company has one of the largest economic reserves of antimony and could supply  of us demand in the first six years of production antimony is considered a critical mineral and is used in batteries munitions and semiconductors the company was recently awarded up to  million in funding for the department of defense to help demonstrate a fully domestic antimony trisulfide supply chain 
 
 
 iperionx ltd ipxax ipxo  market cap a million  iperionx goal is to reshore a fully integrated titanium metal supply chain to the us the company plans on extracting titanium minerals from its titan project in tennessee in addition to producing rare earths and zirconium as coproducts the company plans on producing highperformance titanium alloys from titanium minerals or scrap titanium

 the bls is reporting the march unemployment rate down slightly to  percent nowhere near the  percent that it will take to trigger a collapse of confidence   
 zerohedge  has detailed how fake the blss numbers have become in a series of recent posts  yesterdays highlights are here  and  here  
 
 when i was in academics my research program was on the application of psychology to economics especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level 
 back in the s i was featured in a frontpage article in the  wall street journal  on animal spirits or confidence levels 
 i discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily confidence collapses the unemployment rate skyrockets upward and economic activity contracts sharply  
 this event marks the end of the business cycle 
 while the economy has been stagnating for most people recently we have not experienced this signal event the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins

 leading companies announcing layoffs and hiring freezes in  
the following is the list of major layoffs job cuts and hiring freezes announced by leading companies in 

 since january st   companies have announced mass layoffs 
 last update april   emphasis added 
 
 the biden administration is aware of my work and apparently will do anything to prevent the reported unemployment number from climbing to  percent before the election which would trigger a collapse of confidence 
 the adaptation level is currently at  percent look at the graph below 
 there is still a gap of      unemployment percentage points  too wide for people to feel that things are getting worse than what were used to 
 
 the difference between the unemployment rate and the adaptation level can be flipped to be presented as a confidence level  by this metric confidence is still quite high though trending lower 
 
 real per capita personal income is almost exactly on trend for the past  years  
 consumers may have a lingering covidbubblestimmychecksinduced feeling of wealth as well having recovered from a dip in  
 the recent experience has been nothing like the years following the great financial crisis 
 
 unfortunately more fake data from the bls coming on top of all the fake data from the fda and cdc over the past four years will only further extinguish any confidence the american people have in their governments statistical releases or in their government in general 
 perhaps the bls will simply stop reporting an unemployment number this is what the chinese did with their youth unemployment series 
 or perhaps theyll issue a report with all the data redacted like the fda did with their myocarditis analysis every page was redacted 
 the strong report this morning suggests that rates will stay higher for longer than many expect note in the chart below showing the inflation rate and the month tbill rate that the peak in shortterm interest rates came a year after the peak in inflation the last time the fed was battling with inflation during the  recessions 
 
 with the wef cabal pursuing their goal of global famine by destabilizing oil production in the middle east thereby especially starving china of the means to run its economy and feed its population a global oil shock appears to be in the making

"by brian mcglinchey via  stark realities 
 a principal  goal  of  stark realities  is to expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum  and  few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that us participation in world war ii lifted the american economy out of the great depression  
 this myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesnt really exist but also because  it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns  that belief in turn has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds  trillion with interest payments alone on pace to reach  trillion a year in  inviting  financial catastrophe  
 in part the wartimeprosperity myth springs from the fact that during conflict on the scale of world war ii broad macroeconomic  measures like gross national product gnp and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economys most important facet the standard of living  enjoyed  or endured by everyday people 
 between  and  real gnp rose at an unprecedented    annual clip using gnp alone one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living with americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods accompanied by a rise in quality selection and affordability 
 the reality was the exact opposite  americans endured rationing shortages declining product quality and the outright unavailability of many new goods  such as cars trucks and stoves this was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve peoples lives setting aside the separate issue of the wars justness 
 
 in many respects  america experienced an outright economic devolution  in the preceding century industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity during world war ii however shortages motivated people whod contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it the scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible 
 those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase  wrote  steven horwitz and michael j mcphillips  the household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone 
 gnp wasnt the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading the us unemployment rate plummeted from    in  to    in  note however that military service members are not considered part of the labor force  which means that the draft extracted    million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation 
 another  million volunteered though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman 
 while its true that draftees and volunteers were employed by the armed forces  all these millions of men  no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been  werent doing anything to create prosperity at home  
 not a prosperous path to full employment soldiers under withering fire on ddays omaha beach 
 thats not to say the war machine didnt demand laborers with so many able men taken out of the economy the slack was taken up by teenagers women and retirees many whod have preferred to be doing other things 
 in a growing economy more people are producing goods and services and elevating standards of living in the process that was far from the case during world war ii  factories were humming but they were making bayonets bombs and battleships  fourtenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future noted  robert higgs  
 defying conventional wisdom about wartime prosperity  americans standard of living suffered tremendously from their governments entry into world war ii  in  the reality of the wartime economy  horwitz and mcphillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of american life during world war ii into sharp focus 
 for example a series of newspaper ads placed by canton electric light  power company  a local new york state utility  present  a vivid timelapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the december  declaration of war  
 
 foreshadowing anticipated shortages a march   ad for appliances is headlined you can still buy them the ad includes a qualifier thats upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity we have a fairly good supply 
 
 
 just two months later canton electrics ad says now is the time to buy various appliances and equipment warning that production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers stock is available 
 
 
 another two months later a july  ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory 
 
 
 in november of that first year of americas world war ii participation canton electric switched to warning consumers that due to the war emergency it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use and urging them to ensure theyre properly maintaining their stokers and oil burners 
 
 
 later that same month canton electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food eat everything on their plates and comply with rationstamp rules 
 
 
 horwitz and mcphillips also drew on  letters  written between  and  by saidee leach to her son serving in the pacific contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping gnp or plummeting unemployment she tells him of 
 
 conserving scarce homeheating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen 
 
 
 having her typewriter seized by the government and now using a lesser model she acquired from a howard johnson which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving 
 
 
 making an easter dinner centered on fried spam because she could not get fresh meat of any kind and later noting that potatoes have entirely disappeared 
 
 
 local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the office of price administration  illustrating the folly of government price controls 
 
 that is not the picture of an economy delivered from the great depression rather  world war ii institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services  wrote  peter ferrara  the economic deprivation and reduced standards of living continued although people perceived it was now for a good cause 
 americas postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth  of wartime prosperity 
 as the wars end grew closer  keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster  for example paul samuelson  said  america would experience the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced  
 alvin hansen  warned  that the economy must be kept on a centrallycontrolled wartime footing even in peacetime when the war is over the government cannot just disband the army close down munitions factories stop building ships and remove all economic control 
 nobel prize winner paul samuelson who predicted peace would bring economic disaster taught nobel laureate paul krugman who predicted the internets impact would be akin to that of the fax machine 
 however thats pretty much what happened  and  hansen samuelson and their fellow economic flatearthers couldnt have been more wrong  about the consequences the year  when civilian output increased by about  percent was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the us economy wrote  higgs  
 this  despite the fact that   government purchases of goods and services collapsed by    between the second quarter of  and the first quarter of   and upwards of a  million  civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged 
 as warfighting men poured back into civilian life millions of women withdrew from the labor force contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers rather than soaring as predicted by the experts unemployment merely edged higher from  in  to    in  
 less than a year and a half after vjday  crowed  president truman more than  million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in  the swiftest and most gigantic changeover that any nation has ever made from war to peace  note this happened despite  and in part  because of   trumans failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended 
 having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace  keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom  arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted however as higgs determined by studying the data of the time holdings of liquid assets  did not decline at all  after the war people financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate 
 once again an engine of real prosperity in  vehicles proceed along fords first postwar assembly line  ford motor company archives 
 contrary to the myth it was only after world war ii that   free from the governments commandeering of factories workers and resources  and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions  america was finally able to emerge from the great depression 
 you wouldnt know that if you evaluated the economys health using keynesians preferred measure just as the gnp gauge provided a degree misreading of wartime economic realities it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom from  to  gnp plummeted  
 in addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures  americas postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of world war iifostered prosperity  and to the idea that government spending central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery

 and its the armys own fault the west point mafia has systematically destroyed our nations maritime strength  
 when i was  vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war youve fell victim to one of the classic blunders never get involved in a land war in asia  
 yet in my adult life the united states fought not one but two wars in asia  
 how did we pay for those by gutting our maritime capabilities  
 with chinese military capability growing exponentially how do you win a war in asia the same way we did in ww with ships  marines with the army and air force serving a support role  
 except there is a problem the current and last secretaries of defense are west pointers the secdef before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the secretary of state who was a west pointer  
 two decades of land wars in asia have decimated our maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into army coffers by the west point mafia demon in dc  
 and now that the land wars are over is the army corps of engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges is the army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges is it working jointly with the seabees and merchant marine is it rebuilding watercraft  
 no todays west point mafia leader jack reed controls the powerful senate armed services committee  has blocked the future of the navy commission that congress created to develop a naval rebuilding strategy  
 now under general lloyd austin  reed every single navy shipbuilding project is delayed  
 the west point mafia has gutted every maritime service  
 navy national guard naval militia now only a boat service in a small handful of states  
 united states navy armed guard gone  
 us navy reserve zero ships in inventory  
 uscg icebreaker fleet down to one ship  
 us navy salvage fleet mostly gone  
 seabees cut to  active personnel  
 merchant marine now less than  ships in international service  
 marad ready reserve fleet small  on average age a half century old  
 us maritime service just a handful of officers at the us merchant marine academy  
 marine hospital service gone except the uniforms  
 noaa officer corps down to  officers  
 army corps of engineers dredge fleet includes ancient hulls like the yearold dredge mcfarland  
 army corps of engineers salvage the last secdef esperdod sold all army salvage vessels in baltimore 
 army watercraft gutted by at action by esper  
 uscg forced to cut  cutters this year alone  
 i could go on but i have something more important to say  
  now they are coming for the carriers and submarines 
 i will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post  of the thread  
 if jack reed  the west point mafia wins the next war in asia will be lost  
 problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks defense contractors and dod civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in navy or coast guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out jack reed  general austin in the media or during a senate hearing  
 ps why am i using quotes from the princess bride  making light of the problem by creating the west point mafia demon meme because it doesnt require a phd to see what is happening  
 the gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into land wars is something any  year can see is idiotic

"a divide among democrats over whether to halt defense aid to israel is growing more fierce causing a crisis and headache for biden strategists ahead of the presidential election which has only intensified in the wake of last weeks israel defense forces idf attack on the world central kitchen convoy in gaza which left seven international workers dead including an american 
 this  intensifying fragmentation of bidens base  has been on display this weekend also given former house speaker nancy pelosi  still very influential among dems  has publicly come out against bidens policy to continue arming israel the issue is entering the heart of the democratic establishment threatening unity 
 axios  reports  that she  signed onto a call by progressive members of congress for the us to stop transferring weapons to israel  over a strike that killed seven aid workers in gaza 
 via afp 
 the  letter  she signed and which was led by reps mark pocan dwisc jim mcgovern dmass and jan schakowsky dill included the signatures of some  democrats 
 in light of the recent strike against aid workers and the everworsening humanitarian crisis  we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers  the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to president biden and secretary of state antony blinken 
 if this strike is found to have violated us or international law  we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable  the lawmakers wrote 
 however a followup statement from a pelosi representative to  axios  has this to say speaker pelosi knows president bidens support for israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in gaza and she respects his judgment in how to proceed 
 this trend of the gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from  epoch times   proisrael democrat group endorses squad primary opponents  
 
 a democrat proisrael group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the farleft congressional group the squad 
 democratic majority for israel dmfi announced on april  its backing of westchester county executive george latimer and st louis county prosecuting attorney wesley bell 
 dmfi did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcing  a slate  of endorsements 
 
 so now the fight is on and its becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side  still those voters who put the squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the  antiisrael  side  
 another indicator that the internal democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a longstanding white house tradition  muslim leaders are boycotting an annual white house ramadan gathering  which marks the end of the muslim  season of fasting    
 
 the biden administration is hosting a scaleddown ramadan gathering for muslim and arab americans after  several community leaders declined the invite over the unrelenting and steadfast nature of us support for israels war  on gaza 
 the event scheduled for tuesday will be in  stark contrast to previous muslim celebrations  and gatherings under the biden administration which have seen packed ballrooms of muslims from all over the country joining the white house festivities  
 this year the iftar will be  confined to staffers only  and a separate gathering will take place for muslim community members 
 
 
 us muslims reject biden this ramadan 
after boycotting the white houses annual iftar invitation american muslims staged an iftar protest outside demanding an end to us arms to israel  a ceasefire 
muslim community anger in america has risen over the us loyal  pictwittercomwtbxkelpbh 
 pillars pillarsuk  april   
 one such muslim community leader and activist told  middle east eye  that palestinianamericans are  vehemently opposed to any palestinian arab muslim or any person who has an ounce of humanity  attending the event 
 all of this is of course a plus for trumps chances of retaking the white house going into november also given the israelgaza issue is much less of a divisive flashpoint issue for republican voters

"authored by sheramy tsai via the epoch times  
 one in five americans regularly reach for vitamin d supplements yet  most are unaware that theyre taking not just a vitamin   but a hormone  
 while renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health vitamin ds story is not straightforward a blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact 
 
 vitamin d understanding its dual role 
 vitamin d stands apart in the world of nutrients its a sunsourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone this dual role is significant as hormones which orchestrate many bodily functions arent typically taken as supplements like vitamins 
 endocrinologist dr michael holick a leading vitamin d expert tells the epoch times  the body more effectively utilizes vitamin d when its naturally synthesized from sunlight compared to standard supplement doses  
 this difference is key to understanding vitamin ds health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone 
 unlike most nutrients the hormonal nature of vitamin d means it has a broader systemic impact influencing not just bone health but also immune function cell growth and inflammation control  this understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation 
 beyond bone health 
 vitamin d is more than just a bone health and immune system booster its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health 
 at its core vitamin d is vital for calcium absorption in the gut and essential for bone strength and health without enough vitamin d the body can only absorb  percent of calcium  dr alex foxman  a leading internist and preventive care specialist told the epoch times insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks 
 moreover vitamin d is pivotal for immune health dr holick observes  vitamin d receptors are in almost every cell including immune cells  proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders 
 dr nathan goodyear  an integrative cancer physician and director of brio medical an integrative cancer treatment center in scottsdale arizona stresses vitamin ds essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases like cancer he explains the immune system does not work well if vitamin d is not optimal  emphasizing its role in cancer where immune strength is crucial 
 recent research including melanoma  studies  indicates that vitamin d supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations 
 vitamin d also plays a significant role in heart health 
 studies  have linked low vitamin d levels to an elevated risk of heart disease those deficient in vitamin d are more likely to experience hypertension heart failure and strokes 
 mental health is another arena where vitamin d plays a significant role  
 kimberly parker a licensed psychotherapist told the epoch times theres a clear link between low levels of vitamin d and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders 
 it also affects seasonal affective disorder a depression variant tied to seasonal changes  i have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin d intake she reports 
 vitamin ds journey from sunlight to cellular powerhouse 
 vitamin d is vital for health existing in different forms each taking a unique path within our body grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin d functions in our system 
 once vitamin d enters our body through sun diet or supplements it transforms to become active  
 first it changes into calcidiol in the liver then into calcitriol its active form in the kidneys dr holick clarifies calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions 
 interestingly each form of vitamin d undergoes a similar conversion process in the body the source of vitamin d might differ but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges 
 the conversion efficiency of vitamin d can differ the skins capacity to produce vitamin d diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation geographical location and lifestyle 
 controversies in vitamin d testing 
 the routine way to measure vitamin d levels in the body is through a blood test called hydroxyvitamin d this measurement reflects vitamin d levels from sunlight food and supplements the  less recommended  dihydroxyvitamin d test fails to gauge vitamin d reserves rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring 
 vitamin d blood testing has surged ranking as medicares  eighth most common  lab test   market reports  pegged the  testing market at  million with projections reaching  billion by  
 once led by giants like abbott siemens and quest diagnostics the vitamin d testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies dr holick recalls years ago i told quest that this would be their number one seller 
 more than  million vitamin d blood tests are done annually in the united states even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations  dr morton tavel a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease told the epoch times he references a   virginia health system study  where  percent of patients underwent vitamin d tests often without medical indication 
 beyond adults vitamin d testing in children skyrocketed fold in  years as per a  bmj study  though it didnt significantly alter low vitamin d diagnosis rates 
 this increase in vitamin d testing contrasts with medical associations  guidelines  which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic lowrisk individuals 
 for instance the  endocrine society  recommends screening only highrisk groups the  us preventive services task force  sees insufficient evidence for universal screening  choosing wisely  also advises against testing in lowrisk groups including the general population 
 dr joel finkelstein from massachusetts general hospitals bone density center as reported in a harvard health  blog  voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin d deficiency screening deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary 
 vitamin d has been hyped massively he states we do not need to be checking the vitamin d levels of most healthy individuals he challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin d noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin common in sunrich areas 
 however many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin d testing 
 the college of naturopathic medicine  advises  those in sunpoor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance 
 aligning with this view dr goodyear emphasizes the tests relevance particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer he told the epoch times vitamin d will always be low in the place of significant inflammation both acute and chronic advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation 
 dr goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin d levels in such conditions he likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies  the process is to evaluate dose reevaluate and then redose  he adds 
 reflecting the views of linus pauling considered to be the father of vitamin c dr goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies he explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins he advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin d therapy moving away from a onesizefitsall methodology 
 defining optimal vitamin d levels 
 according to  the us preventative services task force no consensus exists on the definition of vitamin d deficiency or the optimal level of total serum hydroxyvitamin 
 some experts view ohd levels under  ngml as deficient common standards suggest  ngml as sufficient yet  many functional health practitioners  advocate for an optimal range of  ngml 
 recommendations according to the  national institutes for health  nih 
 
 the  nih  clarifies that optimal vitamin d levels are unestablished as they vary by stage of life by race and ethnicity and with each physiological measure used 
 contrasting these guidelines voices like dr goodyears claim current vitamin d dose recommendations are too low he labels the current us recommended daily allowances as woefully inadequate 
 dr goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin d levels this stance argues for higher optimal ranges implying current standards dont fully exploit the vitamins health potential 
 too much of a good thing 
 vitamin d is vital however theres concern about its overconsumption particularly via supplements  unlike watersoluble vitamins which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess vitamin d is fatsoluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels termed vitamin d intoxication 
 dr holick cautions that vitamin d intoxication though extremely rare is severe sun exposure cant cause vitamin d toxicity but excessive supplementation can any excess vitamin d made by the sun is destroyed by the sun you can never become vitamin d intoxicated from sun exposure but you can from supplements if you take too much he warns 
 vitamin d toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood leading to nausea vomiting and weakness if untreated it can escalate to kidney damage bone pain and rarely death 
 some practitioners including pam schoenfeld a registered dietitian assert that excessive vitamin d intake can lead to the depletion of retinol the active form of vitamin a ms schoenfeld told the epoch times the current landscape of vitamin d supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fatsoluble vitamins 
 in  an article  for the weston price foundation ms schoenfeld cautions  more astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin d especially at levels of  iu per day  is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin a intake is optimal  this perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health particularly during pregnancy 
 critics like dr holick challenge this view arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that vitamin d adversely affects vitamin a levels its simply not true he notes 
 the vitamin d supplementation dilemma 
 modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin d contribute to widespread deficiencies despite wellbalanced diets about   in   american adults and   percent  of children fall short of necessary vitamin d levels 
 given these challenges supplementation is an important consideration  current recommendations  call for  international units iu for children up to age  months  iu for people ages  to  and  iu for people over  
 dr holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution especially for the sundeprived  suggesting a total daily intake  of  iu from diet sun and supplements 
 however not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin d to an assortment of medical conditions when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems this wonder supplement failed miserably dr tavel told the epoch times 
 sunshine a prime vitamin d source can fulfill needs with minimal exposure dr tavel notes your vitamin d storage generally lasts for about  to  weeks questioning the need for constant supplementation 
 the vitamin d deficiency debate is complex dr tavel points out that the widespread notion that much of america is walking around deficient in vitamin d came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin d set by the institute of medicine more than a decade ago this has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation 
 yet he explains there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial the american academy of pediatrics advises  iu of vitamin d daily for breastfed infants those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit 
 dr tavel warns that excessive supplementation linked to  increased fall risk  and other hazards underscores the need for balance in vitamin d intake 
 supporting dr tavel new england journal of medicine  research  found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with  iu of vitamin d compared to nonsupplementers 
 vitamin ds necessity varies dr tavel reminds us for much of human history people got their vitamin d mostly from the sun highlighting our bodys innate ability to regulate this nutrient 
 determining vitamin d supplementation requires personal assessment medical consultation and an eye on guidelines generally a mix of diet sun and occasional supplements suffices for most claims dr tavel 
 expanding vitamin d supplement industry 
 the  vitamin d supplement market  is rapidly growing valued at  million in  and expected to reach  million by  growing at  percent annually drivers include an aging population heightened health awareness and a surge in demand for vitaminenriched products 
 in response to consumer demand the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations like gummies sprays patches creams and potent capsules this variety meets diverse preferences and needs including ease of use and better absorption 
 the industrys growth is also propelled by robust marketing and  advertising  pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin d supplements as key to health shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion 
 while this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness it prompts concerns about selfprescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin d consumption 
 best sources of vitamin d 
 sun exposure is key in vitamin d production uvb ultraviolet b rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin d later transformed into calcitriol its usable form interestingly skinproduced vitamin d remains in the bloodstream for about  twice as long  as when ingested by food or vitamins 
 sunlights vitamin d productivity varies by time season and location the best synthesis is between  am and  pm in warmer months however above   degrees latitude  theres negligible vitamin d production from november to march 
 a   study  concluded sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary vit d compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of vit d supplementation moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice 
 the  dminder app  helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin d offering realtime data based on location time and weather 
 dietary sources though fewer contribute to vitamin d intake  fatty fish and  uvexposed mushrooms  are key sources incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin d especially in less sunny periods 
 supplementation particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes is another method  a study  showed that while both sun and oral d supplements raise vitamin d levels supplements were more effective due to compliance simply put more people took supplements than spent time in the sun 
 vitamin d supplements are available as d from plants and d from animals d mirroring the bodys suninduced production is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin d levels 
 however dr holick asserts that physiologic doses of d and d raise vitamin d levels in the blood the same effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health additionally he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms 
 dr holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the united states explaining that vitamin d remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical us food and drug administration approval processes no one ever got approval for d he notes highlighting a regulatory rather than a healthbased reason for vitamin ds dominance in the market 
 though sunlight is the prime vitamin d source its availability is inconsistent diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin d for optimal health 
 key considerations for vitamin d supplementation 
 understanding how to optimize vitamin d supplementation and reduce risks is crucial 
 fatsoluble nature 
 contrary to popular belief and many recommendations dr michael holick argues that vitamin d absorption doesnt depend on dietary fat he cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk low in fat than from fullfat milk hence vitamin d can be taken with or without dietary fat 
 conjunction with other nutrients 
 
 vitamin k   studies suggest  taking vitamins d and k together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks 
 
 
 magnesium  magnesium aids vitamin d metabolism and high vitamin d doses can deplete magnesium levels adequate magnesium is  vital for effective vitamin d use  
 
 
 vitamin a  vitamins a and d both fatsoluble work together but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established 
 
 
 timing of dosage   some suggest  aligning vitamin d intake with circadian rhythms proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances however dr holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin d disrupts sleep making it safe to take at any time 
 
 
 choice of vitamin d type  while d ergocalciferol comes from plants and fortified foods and d cholecalciferol from animal products and sunlight exposure dr holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin d levels equally 
 
 
 consult health care professionals  before starting supplements consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions 
 
 while supplements may be useful integrating them with natural vitamin d sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall wellbeing 
",,2024-04-07,,The Reality Of Vitamin D Supplementation
"authored by jesse smith via truthunmutedorg 
 the gauntlet has been cast by the mediacensorship complex just prior to this years annual globalist confab in davos the world economic forum wef announced that misinformation and disinformation are currently  the greatest threats to humanity  with the release of its  global risks report   
 
 from a list of  risks the wef report identifies mis and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next  years  of particular concern is false information that could affect elections democratic processes and social cohesion in various countries worldwide as well as sentiment contradicting the consensus narrative about climate change 
 echoing these same concerns the united nations un  its strategic partner  in advancing the climatefocused   agenda  for sustainable development  has previously stated  much of the same 
 in  information integrity on digital platforms  a june  un policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms secretarygeneral antónio guterres stated 
 
 the ability to disseminate largescale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an existential risk to humanity a para  and endangers democratic institutions and fundamental human rights these risks have further intensified because of rapid advancements in technology such as generative artificial intelligence across the world the united nations is monitoring how mis and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the sustainable development goals it has become clear that business as usual is not an option 
 
 
 all the uns  agenda plans activities and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions particularly carbon dioxide co this conviction is clearly outlined in  a fact sheet  produced by  verified  a joint initiative of the united nations and  purpose  launched in  to respond to mis and disinformation about intersecting crises like covid and climate change the document states unequivocally that 
 
 climate change is happening 
 
 
 climate change is caused by human activity 
 
 
 scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change 
 
 
 every fraction of a degree of warming matters 
 
 
 the climate is changing faster than humans plants and animals can adapt 
 
 
 climate change is a major threat to peoples health 
 
 
 natural gas is a fossil fuel not a clean source of energy 
 
 
 clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels 
 
 
 entire countries already rely  percent on renewable electricity 
 
 
 renewable energy will soon be the worlds top source of electricity 
 
 
 renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels 
 
 
 solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land 
 
 
 the transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs 
 
 by stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely indisputably and undeniably true  like guterres all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion theory or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion 
 verified is backed by powerful globalist ngos including the rockefeller foundation and omidyar network it has an extensive  list of major media collaborators  such as al jazeera clear channel facebook reddit spotify tiktok and twitter melissa fleming verified cofounder and current un undersecretarygeneral for global communications has made it known that  social media is a huge threat  to climate science and other un initiatives and is particularly  bothered by twitterx  for allowing rampant disinformation 
 it is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the uns   sustainable development goals  sdgs  now urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded 
 while many of the issues expressed in the  information integrity  report are legitimate and concerning the un via the world health organization who participates in disinformation by continuing to  promote covid vaccines  as  safe and effective  when they have largely been proven to be  ineffective and cause much harm  their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the  thousands of scientists  who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists 
 the following statement from the report underscores their frustration with climate deniers and the platforms they use to oppose the uns agenda 
 
 mis and disinformation about the climate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet climate mis and disinformation can be understood as false or misleading content that  undercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of humaninduced climate change  its causes and impacts coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny minimize or distract from the intergovernmental panel on climate change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the  paris agreement  a small but vocal minority of climate science denialists  continue to reject the consensus position and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms p  emphasis added 
 
 globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize censor and discredit dissenters they talk a good game about enforcing  universal freedom of expression  but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda free speech is not tolerated though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism surveillance censorship and the erosion of human rights it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda 
 if they can successfully shut down debate about climate change then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits the un deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the mediacensorship complex its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies 
 countering digital hate or advocating suppression 
 a  recently released report  issued by the  center for countering digital hate ccdh  claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged these new arguments dont deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity but instead contend that 
 
 the impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless 
 
 
 climate solutions wont work 
 
 
 climate science and the climate movement are unreliable 
 
 
 the basis for their report stems from use of an ai based model called  cards  short for  computerassisted recognition of climate change denial and skepticism  cards is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text the researchers used cards to analyze youtube video transcripts from  mostly rightwing conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like blazetv jordan peterson and the heartland institute 
 ccdh has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial they want to eliminate the ability for any climate denier spreading conspiracy theory statements to financially benefit from their content as evidenced in the following statements 
 
 to support the global efforts to avert climate disaster instagram facebook tiktok and x  should all demonetize and deamplify new denial content  demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content moreover deamplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility allowing time for factchecking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the wellestablished scientific consensus on climate change p  emphasis added 
 ccdh polling on social media usage tested respondents agreement with  conspiracy theory statements  including the statement humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases ccdh found that  of adults and  of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement this link between social media usage and  conspiracist belief  illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking p  emphasis added 
 
 their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the cards model is only  up to  accurate  could  not perform any fact checks  on the claims made in the transcripts and that lack of punctuation caused  results to be skewed  
 
 image the new climate denial report page  
 the ccdh is a  sketchy  ukbased advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with their  efforts against antivaxxers  culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming demonetizing and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemicrelated fraud and covid vaccine falsehoods 
 ccdhs  the   new climate denial  report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like cnn msn yahoo and usa today it could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its  disinformation dozen  reports a few years ago though their stated mission is to protect human rights and civil liberties online they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers 
 how the mediacensorship complex plans to tackle climate dissent 
 two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the wef un and ccdh one is that climate skepticism is on the rise the second is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested 
 if one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort 
 
 awareness campaigns 
 
 
 artificial intelligence 
 
 
 censorship 
 
 
 civic listening 
 
 
 content moderation 
 
 
 demonetization  and  financial censorship 
 
 
 deplatforming 
 
 
 digital armies 
 
 
 education 
 
 
 fact checking 
 
 
 media and information literacy 
 
 
 prebunking  psychological inoculation 
 
 
 shadowbanning 
 
 
 trusted messengers 
 
 
 text mining  automated text analysis

 each of these organizations are fueled and funded by many of the entities responsible for advancing the climate agenda especially as it relates to the un sdgs this globalized amalgamation of media watchdogs fact checkers and disinformation regulators is powered by billiondollar corporations democratic and undemocratic governments influential foundations and powerful ngos the list includes  the white house   us state department   us department of defense   us department of homeland security   federal bureau of investigation fbi   the national science foundation   united nations   poynter institute   national endowment for democracy   open society foundations   omidyar network   rockefeller foundation   rockefeller family fund   bill  melinda gates foundation   google   meta   microsoft  and many more 
 a plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations a small sampling includes associated press npr nbc news newsweek the washington post the guardian the nation the corporation for public broadcasting youtube facebook tiktok whatsapp twitch and linkedin a look at  covering climate nows list of partners  provides an even broader view of the medias enforcement of the climate agenda 
 as if governments corporations and organizations werent enough universities such as  columbia harvard oxford and university of southern california  also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions 
 by treating climate change as a  national security threat  the us department of defense and  intelligence agencies  have also been enlisted in the fight against mis and disinformation 
 in addition individuals within  both the left and right wings  of the twoparty paradigm  collude to curtail free speech  it is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial they are both integral to perpetuating the mediacensorship complex 
 why has climate science become nondebatable 
 if it wasnt apparent before it should now be crystal clear that there is a  vast empire  united against those questioning the climate narrative they are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts 
 the truth is there is  no real consensus  on  climate science  the un and its network of publicprivate partnerships ppp just make it seem that way in this regard the un climate stance is akin to  anthony faucis claim  that questioning him was like questioning science itself honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship harassment exclusion or cancellation instead there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies 
 climate consensus figures as high as    and even    percent have been touted by former us presidents researchers and media outlets in the past but is this claim true if it were then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber would all these battles be worth the time energy and money being spent on just  a few  dissidents as they claim 
 
 ninetyseven percent of scientists agree  climate  change is real manmade and dangerous read more  httptcoleebytvqf 
 barack obama barackobama  may   
 much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending manmade disaster the industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove official claims funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line as a result statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus 
 past research  has demonstrated  claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent  in a  paper published in   a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a   study  claiming there was greater than  consensus on climate science in peerreviewed scientific literature 
 the claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored this clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used  falsified research  and  conspired  to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus even if the  consensus assertions were valid the notion of  consensusastruth  does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation the majority can still be wrong 
 a recent article  posted by the good men project  which exposed the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in europe proclaimed that  scientific  consensus  on humancaused climate change is equivalent to that  on evolution   this statement came in response to a request from protest organizer james melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies never mind that evolution is not a  proven fact  equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against again the majority can still be wrong 
 remember when pfizer moderna astrazeneca and johnson  johnson made claims that their covid vaccines were all well over  effective in stopping transmission as evidenced in the following video those proclamations did not hold up very well did they

 a massive army has been assembled to ensure that rival claims will not see the light of day for long but why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research smear dissenters and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues 
 an  article written by gregory  whitstone executive director of the co coalition presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change stating 
 you have likely heard that  of scientists agree on humandriven climate change you may also have heard that those who dont buy into the climateapocalypse mantra are sciencedeniers the truth is that a whole lot more than  of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate a whole lot more 
 there are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven and with which i am confident at least  of scientists agree here are two 
 
 carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years 
 
 
 temperatures as measured by thermometers and satellites have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than  years 
 
 what is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic humancaused co there is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming weve had since  that was directly caused by us 
 we know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia we also know that for virtually all of that time global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the th century 
 the claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable the truth is that we do not know we need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture 
 how can greenhouse gases particularly co be the sole agent  causing rising temperatures  when it is an essential element for all life forms given the growing world population it seems that greater levels of cowould lead to greater benefits plants need co to thrive yet the fight against it is accelerating 
 scientists have now stated that  cow burps and farts  and even human  breathing are bad for the environment  because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide both believed to contribute to global warming this is beyond absurd 
 we are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues there is no good reason why continued debate featuring those on all sides of the issue should not be occurring unless of course there are other reasons for ramming this fearbased agenda down our throats

 it never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information  they have eyes to see and ears to see and yet somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them slapping them in the face 
 so many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics  set in motion by this antiamerican lawless regime  that its nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary but ive tried to give the reader as comprehensive an assessment as i possibly can with this piece 
 michael savage a longtime renown radio host was fond of noting that  liberalism is a mental disorder and were witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism  and so here we are on the cusp of the final fall of america short of a miracle from god or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies 
 it might sound quaint and out of touch with what some have now accepted as the new normal but i say we should all wrap ourselves in the american flag and send out the clarion call for a rush of strong capable men to come to the aid of their country in a manner as never before

 in an ideal and perfect world all americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise but we live in a far from perfect world or society and the fools of the country have abandoned christian kindness the golden rule and humanity for the evil of transhumanism  heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in todays society and political arenas in a manner not too unlike the years between  and  that led to the civil war and tho some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter by and large the democratic party has been completely infiltrated by marxistmaoist communists who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in america as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each persons soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine 
 look around  half or more of americas citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality  either due to the mindnumbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their education in the public school system something genetic or a trauma from their life some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds or a combination of all three 
 some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built america but we dont have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on america if the tide swings its way in the  election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of american principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow  time to gather our likeminded american patriots and those lions of liberty who have had enough of witnessing this america we love so well so sorely abused put upon and assaulted 
 it doesnt help when we have selfserving corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and illinformed from their hell and the misery it brings  if only they will support more madness to be placed in us code vote for more economy killing climate change change regulations and initiatives and well put more money on your ebt cards courtesy of uncle sam and the american taxpayer help us make sure the government has the final say over everybodys children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal and well make certain you get privilege over all other americans one can almost hear traitor joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall you can be a champion among champions they say  let us help you change your gender 
 and if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the us federal government 
 oh yea and as if that isnt bad enough biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive  billion more in student loans he plans to announce this on monday april th  and for anyone with eyes to see this is simply corruption at its worst and biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election what a slap in the face of americans who couldnt afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring 
 i see the immorality growing every day the people who revel in its evil freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity and with each passing day i find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom i have little or nothing in common with adrift from most of humanity too not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation but rather as if to say whew in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those i despise most 
 its sort of like im standing on the river bank watching the ship of fools sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible or worse knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to hell along with them  they think were crazy for defending americas righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them and we think them mad for denying god reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil unrestrained immoral freedom that is no freedom at all a bringer of death 
 since  the communists within the federal government congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred they broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government the leviathan and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country the constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen which traitor joe has done through  executive orders bypassing congress and the us supreme court 
 we have a national debt thats rapidly approaching  trillion and counting that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties but it  couldnt have arrived to this abysmal point without both marxistmaoists and rinos accepting the tenets of the marxistkeynesian modern monetary theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence which is currently being proven wrong  our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new generation z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion even tho many of them are a great part of the problem some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the lgbtq sickness running rampant through american society advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention 
 several decades ago i realized every government in the world was using a keynesian debtbased system printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it  basically the world had gone mad as the greed of its socalled leaders knew no bounds and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money  the charade is ongoing and the casino open that is til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of the great reset 
 in  as i watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard george bush say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it i received a strong sense that america may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out i had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed too big to fail 
 in unbelievable fashion when the largest economic collapse in us history hit in march  to be followed by the covid lockdowns pushed and kept going for years by traitors to america such as dr anthony fauci and dr deborah birx many of us saw it for the fraud it was still whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed as a timid american people complied by and large because they couldnt simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots no even now as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cottoncandy on a rainy day far too many especially the communists among us hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that outofcontrol spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nations economy 
 who could have possibly known at the time  other than those deep state bad actors behind the curtain  that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our free market capitalist system  who knew that  if one believes obama and now biden  the cure for debt was more debt the cure for greed was more greed and that envy of the neighbors possessions was perfectly acceptable even if one easily walked on over to take them by force through armed robbery and who could have foreseen that every marxistmaoist of the democratic party would become modern day jezebels condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of america 
 but never in my wildest imagination did i expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional america  to transform america  and bring great harm to all americans in the process as evil was called good and good was called evil turning the world upside down as foretold in isaiah  as we all witnessed in  driven by the democratic party communists and fascists and globalists of the country for the most part never did i expect to see us science so corrupted and in denial of real science reality itself as supposedly educated people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men  that men actually have periods and can have babies 
 and as  the american people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the biden regime  the biden regime has just recently january th ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold and its still on hold as of this writing april th while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized and in the meantime the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum 
 i dont think the biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy americas energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse as we were under the trump administration its going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity fossil fuels or heat and all hell will be unleashed once americans start being forced to sit in the dark shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat 
 when i hear rachel madcow maddow and chris crybaby matthews talking about republicans who support trump being members of a cult with crazy ideas i think how ironic that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk  they are so insane that they dont even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they dont know they call themselves the normal people as their despot leader traitor joe dismantles and tears the american republic down around the shoulders of all americans 
 in listening to many proponents of the democratic party communist platform and agenda  representative alexandria ocasiocortez senator nancy pelosi and senator chuck schumer for three in particular  i cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates and so here we are in america where the inmates of mental institutions federal prisons illegal aliens drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the oval office today 
 i have noted in several past articles i do believe the united states is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown hot civil war  what will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an ironfisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current federal system has allowed and the biden regime has done trampling on the entire constitution and our inalienable godgiven rights in the process 
 although i refuse to accept any excuse for the farreaching incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information with books aplenty in every public library too there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores even hundreds of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarianminded movement and save themselves their families and communities and america herself they do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency unless one looks at leadership in texas and florida and the current manufactured border crisis 
 twentyfive state governors stood alongside governor abbot of texas in the border dispute with the biden regime  and the governor of south carolina sent his own national guardsmen to the border to assist the texas national guard and texass various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for americas survival so although i was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all america and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the biden regime 
 america has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies  two opposing worldviews  with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty they are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm with the democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable 
 the heavy infiltration of illegal aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of america is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love america since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy america  no one should be oblivious to the fact that various sleeper cells of hamas and hezbollah have been in america for several decades now  taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all american history 
 nineteenth century french economist and writer frederic bastiat could have been speaking of america today and the situation she currently finds herself as he once stated 
 
 when misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable punishes virtue and rewards vice encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe 
 
 americans from all across the country have either been  complicit in this current treason to fundamentally transform america into something strange and foreign to the founding or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemiesfromwithin  in a manner thats proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of american patriots by the fbi and the doj but basically the nation is just about to reap the full terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago and everyone had better prepare as best as they can 
 we cant stop what is headed down the road towards us no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today  not if we outlawed all deviancy abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in womens sports or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight  the die has been cast and no one single man or woman sitting in the oval office can change what is coming not trump or rfk jr or anyone else who wants to give it a try 
 all good and decent americans who can still remember what america used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation  an exceptional nation  she has been in years gone by will soon be forced to fight against enemiesfromwithin and foreign enemies supported by the world economic forum and the united nations so that our friends families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land and as we fight we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos in order that we may purge the land of those who hate america and restore her to a land that truly understands what equality under the law actually means to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the inalienable godgiven rights for all restoring america as something better than she has been in a long long time 
 this is the war that lays ahead of us looming just over the horizon and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success the death of america as she has stood is guaranteed unless libertyminded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war that is the reality and the future we now must face 
 keep ringing the bell  the liberty bell and the sound of freedom from sea to shining sea

americans hate to however reframing the concept can yield more positive results experts said they cringe at the word budgeting said winnie sun cofounder of sun group wealth partners based in irvine california its sort of like telling someone they need to diet and eat healthy said sun a member of cnbcs about  of consumers say a budget would help them reach their personal and family goals yet  say they have never had a budget according to a sun estimates more than  of her clients feel as if theyre literally going to suffer if sun mentions budgeting conversations around budgeting are generally distilled into two camps spending on needs ie essential items and wants nonessential items this framework is meant to help weigh ones financial priorities thereby keeping spending in check but the exercise can turn budgeting into a feeling of deprivation  and people rebel as a result the classic financial advice of slashing spending on wants such as entertainment social connection dating and education for example is at odds with the natural process of human motivation newcomb wrote yes the numbers must work but your life must work too she wrote otherwise youll internally resist your budget and we all know how that can play out financial experts recommend reframing the budgeting concept as a positive rather than a negative for example households can think of it as raising funds instead of cutting spending sun said they can also establish financial goals for example what do they want to do with their extra funds that may be paying down debt saving for the long term or growing a pot of money for shorterterm goals such as a vacation sun said we let the goals lead the act of budgeting she said for me a budget is not about restricting myself lynnette khalfanicox a personal finance expert known as the money coach similarly newcomb recommends identifying new strategies that can meet ones needs and simultaneously save money newcomb gives the reallife example of a husband and wife who argued about how much money he spends on his boat each year his needs are about selfactualization he enjoys the wind in his hair and the sun on his face she seeks safety and security which are also important to her quality of life here the husband found a new strategy offering sailing lessons to teens at his yacht club which helped offset the cost of his boat and allowed his wife to funnel that additional income into savings there are other easy ways households can find extra money without sacrificing much sun said for example households with more than one streaming service can opt to use one service for six months then change to another for the next six months decreasing their streaming budget by  she said households with an ample emergency fund intact can consider shopping for auto and other insurance policies with a higher deductible than their current policy likely lowering monthly premiums sun said in the event of an insurance claim the emergency fund can meet the deductible she said they can also commit to doing curbside pickup when shopping for groceries for example shoppers make purchases more mindfully and avoid instore impulse buying sun said she finds clients generally save  to  or more on their groceries this way any additional cash flow can immediately be used to pay down debt or go into longterm savings or toward a shortterm goal she said ultimately if there is a money issue she challenges clients to decrease their spending by  to  during the month after each week of success she encourages them to celebrate by making memories instead of debt perhaps by doing something with friends or hanging out at a park beach or someones backyard you have to have a joy to replace that negative she said ,,2024-04-07,,People hate budgeting.

new cars today are loaded with hightech features for car shoppers but with those advancements come questions about as much advancement as we have when it comes to new features many of them are data dependent he said whether its through a almost every new vehicle collects different types of details about you  and they will share and sell that data according to a more from personal finance most of the reviewed brands  share personal data with service providers data brokers and other parties not named the report found about  or  of the consulted brands said they sell customer data to third parties only two car brands currently allow users to delete their personal data mozilla found renault and dacia this is still kind of the wild wild west of data collection and aggregation said theresa payton the founder president and chief executive officer of fortalice solutions a cybersecurity advisory firm there are several challenges that remain in place for consumers she said as drivers try to find the best car that fits within their budgets and their own privacy concerns to be sure data collected by cars nowadays may not be too different from that shared from the cellphones already in our pocket said tom mcparland a contributing writer for automotive website jalopnik and operator of vehiclebuying service automatch consulting said drury think about how you use your phone theres a lot of stuff that people dont realize that theyve already given up when it comes to data while it remains to be difficult to do your own research there are three steps car shoppers can take as they assess potential new cars experts say once you narrow your options down to a specific vehicle the first thing you can do is talk to the dealership and see what insight they can give you on that brands data collection practices experts say you can ask representatives at the dealership about a carmakers privacy policies and if you have the ability to optin or optout of data collection data aggregation and data monetization  or the selling of your data to thirdparty vendors said payton additionally ask if you can be anonymized and not have the data aggregated under your name and your vehicles unique identifying number she said people at the dealership might even point you towards talking to the service manager who often has to deal with any repairs and any follow up and technical components said drury your service provider or the service adviser is actually going to have a little more insight versus the salesperson he said it may also be worthwhile to ask your auto insurance provider about car data collection said drury auto insurers may be receiving data of this nature as automakers share or sell it while people at the dealership will have some knowledge on a specific vehicle the insurance provider might give a better holistic view of it because theyre covering many different makes and models he said id ask the insurance company are you using this and do you have an option to opt in or opt out different devices to monitor said drury these days many newer vehicles essentially have an onboard computer if you dont want to be tracked or have vehicle data collected and shared you might find instructions in your owners manual on how to wipe out your personalized data and information from the onboard computer said payton that can be a great way if you are already in a car and you love the car but you dont like the data tracking she said while you may not know if the data was already collected and sent out to third parties you could do this on a periodic basis she said some separate online tools might also help an online resource called privacycars can help users delete personal data stored by automakers including text messages and geolocations payton said they are providing this tool to help users understand the data their cars collect and to give them an option to safeguard their privacy she said in a recent episode from the new york times the daily podcast a woman paid a mechanic  to remove the device in her vehicle that provided internet connectivity she essentially while it may be possible to isolate and remove a car part or chip like this you cant just rip out a cpu of a car said mcparland almost everything nowadays is going to have these integrated systems he said drury agreed these systems are so integrated with everything that your vehicles doing the sensors  that help with a vehicles semiautonomous features those are wired to your throttle to your steering to your breaks it can be extremely dangerous for somebody to go around there and start unplugging things drivers can always tap into the older used car market to find a vehicle without hightech features but such cars might have their own risks the older they are said mcparland additionally the cars onboard computer can provide a lot of safety features like car alerts said payton if you were to ostensibly turn off the onboard computer you might miss out its finding that right balance its a risk versus reward ,,2024-04-07,,"As new vehicles become more like computers, what car shoppers need to know about protecting their data"

the idea of using preassembled components in housebuilding is modern techenabled versions of modular housing promise a faster more sustainable solution to housing crises according to experts but the sector has seen better adoption in some countries compared to others where it has failed to scale  such as the uk prefabrication has existed in many forms from the fast forward a century and entire modules can be built in factories to then be combined to create houses in the fact that modular housing is also made in a controlled factory environment means less waste is generated while also resulting in more building entire sections in one place also means fewer delivery trips to sites shepherd explained a  another study by academics at the university of cambridge and edinburgh napier university published in  found that modular home construction can result in despite these benefits the sector has seen a number of setbacks in recent years and it remains relatively nascent in the uk and us in january it was reported that uk firm modulous had jonatan pinkse professor of sustainable business at kings college london highlighted that part of the challenge for modular construction firms is that they first have to spend money on building a factory in which to construct modules and then need to have the projects in the pipeline to pay for this investment he suggested that this presented more difficulty when coupled with the headwinds that also affected the wider construction sector including higher energy costs and interest rates as well as a costofliving crisis in many nations prompting people to hold off on house buying and if you then cant profit from a market that is actually going up but instead is going down then the problem is simply that firms cant earn back their money fast enough and investors then lose their trust in the business model pinkse told cnbc pinkse was one of the coauthors on suzanne peters who also coauthored the research and is a research associate at alliance manchester business school told cnbc that the construction sector more broadly is a very tough business with a higher amount of failures versus other industries provisional similarly daniel paterson director of government affairs at make uk modular said that the modular housing sector had faced a series of unfortunate events as the industry had essentially only launched in the uk in its current format in  he explained that firms then need around  months to build factories meaning it wasnt long before the covid pandemic hit along with the economic headwinds that followed perceptions based on previous versions of prefabrication was another issue according to richard valentineselsey head of european living research and consultancy at savills research he told cnbc that in the uk there is the s hangover from prefabrication and the kind of connotations that has with lower quality things that dont last and all the kind of negative impacts of that from the building boom postwar in addition he said that the construction industry is quite a conservative beast and finds it very challenging at times to change and think forward and innovate unless their forced to do it which has kind of led to flirtation with new methods but no kind of wholesale change towards delivering using modular sweden and japan are the countries cited as by comparison a make uk modular in sweden one of the major players in this space is boklok which is jointly owned by construction firm skanska and homes and furniture company ikea and has been around since the mids shepherd pointed out that sweden is also not a country where you can build  months of the year they have very deep winters with limited daylight so there is an incentive to look at an alternative construction process to keep people working all year to get houses delivered at the volume needed he explained valentineselsey said that in japan there was also a difference in the approach to residential buildings in japan the value of the building depreciates over about  years so by the end of that you kind of knock it down and rebuild it because it is worthless he explained making new building methods useful given that the delivery of new homes is higher looking at these examples could methods such as modular help tackle the uks affordable housing shortage the current uk government has the target of building  homes a year but thats  houses a year and there is zero chance  of that happening if there is not some form different approach adopted shepherd said looking ahead valentineselsey said he was an optimist in his outlook for the modular sector i think were probably going to see an uptake again over the next five to  years he said however he believed that greater adoption of other types of mmc such as panelized solutions was more likely but thought modular will form part of that new mix of delivery ,,2024-04-07,,Modular homes were hailed as a solution to housing crises.

a paper mill in a small mississippi town could help demonstrate whether capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing it deep underground is a viable path to fight climate change the proposed project at amazon the vicksburg paper mill project is just one example of how carbon capture and storage technology today is expensive logistically complex and faces controversy over its role in the energy transition and safety concerns in communities where pipeline infrastructure would be expanded the parisbased international energy agency has described carbon capture and storage as critical to achieve global netzero emissions while also warning the oil and gas industry against using the technology as a way to maintain the status quo on fossil fuels some climate activists accuse the industry of simply investing in carbon capture as way to extend the use of oil and gas the technology typically uses chemical absorption to capture carbon dioxide emitted from the chimney of an industrial plant the emissions are condensed into a fluid for transport normally through a pipeline and are stored thousands of feet below ground in depleted oil wells or geological formations such as saltwater reservoirs the challenges to implementing the technology are immense the world needs to capture more than  billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by  more than  times the  million metric tons captured in  according to the iea by  the amount of carbon thats captured needs to reach  billion tons  more than  times the  level according to the agency but the track record of carbon capture and storage so far has been one of underperformance with only  of announced projects having reached a final investment decision according to the iea the industry needs to demonstrate that the technology can operate economically at scale after struggling to ramp up deployment for years the agency says the vicksburg papermill project is still in an early development stage slb is confident that it will prove technologically viable said fred majkut senior vice president of carbon solutions at the company the goal is to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is also economically viable majkut said the economic viability of carbon capture and sequestration is a challenge today because the cost of building most plants in order to capture carbon dioxide are very significant the executive said it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit an industrial plant he said for international paper the vicksburg project is a potential way to produce lower carbon products for consumers who are climate conscious and a potential opportunity to benefit financially through the sale of carbon credits there are examples in the marketplace where customers have the opportunity to express their preferences economically whether thats clicking a button to say they want to abate the carbon emissions for a trip in an uber or an airplane said adam miklos director of low carbon innovation at international paper ultimately it has the potential to reduce our emissions and if successful present an opportunity to sell carbon and renewable credits miklos said the mississippi mill is a snapshot of how the oil and gas industry is trying to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is a viable tool in the race to slash emissions after using similar technology for decades to extract oil the industry has used carbon storage techniques since the s in a process called enhanced oil recovery in which carbon dioxide is injected underground to create pressure that pushes more crude toward production wells chevron total spending on carbon capture and storage projects is expected to reach  billion worldwide by  if all announced projects materialize according rystad energy the united states and the united kingdom are the leaders with investments expected to reach  billion and  billion respectively by the end of the decade according to rystad in the us investment in carbon management technologies more than doubled to  billion in  the first full year after the passage of the inflation reduction act according to the cement plants for example produce emissions not only by burning fossil fuels but also due to the materials used in the manufacturing process about twothirds of the industrys carbon dioxide emissions come from chemical reactions that occur when breaking down limestone cement is one of the most widelyused products globally second only to drinking water and is responsible for about  of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions alone right now these types of industries have no way to effectively decarbonize to net zero without carbon capture majkut said if they want to produce cement there will be co emissions simply because of the materials that are being used with carbon storage already a mature commercial business slb is trying to tackle the capture side which presents one of the major hurdles to scaling up the technology due to its high cost according to majkut the solvent that would be used to catch carbon dioxide molecules at the mississippi mill promises to lower the energy requirements of the capture process and make it more cost effective he said were quite comfortable that in the next  to  months we will be coming to market with actually that chemistry as part of our core offering and develop what we call process design packages majkut said slb ceo olivier le peuch has said carbon capture and storage will play a leading role in the companys annual revenue targets of  billion by  and  billion by  for its new energy portfolio slb this month announced a nearly  million investment in aker carbon capture a pureplay carbon capture company based in norway in an effort to accelerate deployment of the technology at commercial scale competitor baker hughes is developing direct air capture technology after acquiring a company called mosaic materials in  baker hughes has not disclosed the value of the deal the technology aims to catch low concentration carbon dioxide emissions which are harder to capture directly from the atmosphere as well as from industrial plants baker hughes anticipates the technology will most likely come to market by the end of  baker hughes is targeting up to  billion in orders by  for its new energy portfolio which includes carbon capture and storage technology the company is forecasting a total market for its new energy business of between  billion and  billion by the end of the decade by  i do believe were going to start to see these technologies start to become reasonably competitive said alessandro bresciani senior vice president of climate technologies at baker hughes the gulf coast of the united states home to enormous oil and gas and other industrial plants is emerging as a center of carbon capture and storage investments in the us jeff gustavson vice president of lower carbon energies at chevron said the region has the potential to quickly increase use of the technology because of favorable geology for storage located close to high concentration emissions that are easier to capture at a lower cost some  million tons of carbon dioxide are emitted annually from houston through to port arthur texas gustavson said chevron exxon over the past two years has entered agreements to capture carbon emissions from ammonia and fertilizer producer dan ammann president of low carbon solutions at exxon said those three contracts combined promise to remove  million tons of emissions annually  the equivalent of converting  million gaspowered cars to electric vehicles exxon completed its acquisition of the carbondioxide pipeline operator denbury for  billion in late  the deal gave exxon more than  miles of pipeline stretching through mississippi louisiana and texas that are located near at least  storage sites in the region it gives us sort of instantaneous scale instantaneous reach across this huge source of emissions along the gulf coast ammann said of the denbury acquisition it gives us the ability to develop storage all along that pipeline as well exxon says it now owns the largest carbon dioxide pipeline network in the us as the infrastructure comes together exxon is seeing a very high level of interest from a lot of different emitters along the gulf coast ammann said chevron is the operator and lead investor in a flagship project called bayou bend which has a  acre position of permanent carbon dioxide storage space near port arthur and beaumont texas the project is a joint venture with minority shareholders negotiations are currently underway with potential customers gustavson said declining to disclose names the area is home to large petrochemical refinery liquid natural gas and industrial gas operations with significant carbon dioxide footprints he said bayou bend could be one of the largest co storage projects in the world youre talking several million tons a year of storage gustavson said the project has the potential for even more storage capacity depending on how much technical progress is made the executive said while the iea has described carbon capture and storage as essential to slash emissions in sectors like heavy industry agency director fatih birol issued a sharply worded statement in november calling on the oil and gas industry to let go of the illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution to climate change birols comments came on the back of an were not saying carbon capture can be implemented everywhere slbs majkut said as a matter of fact the primary way to decarbonize should be energy efficiency scale up of renewables and effectively carbon capture shall be used on applications that you cant easily electrify that you cant easily decarbonize otherwise increasing carbon capture and storage to meet netzero emissions goals in the us will require a massive expansion of pipeline infrastructure the department of energy the key is the right geology close by to concentrated emissions gustavson said thats where we see this scaling fastest first but over time we will need to build more co infrastructure to be able to transport co much longer distances to access the same storage but the permitting process is challenging because pipelines often cross state lines requiring lengthy approval from multiple jurisdictions and creating bottlenecks majkut said pipeline expansion has faced opposition in communities where residents are denbury said in a the energy department says carbon dioxide pipelines have a better safety record than natural gas pipelines and other large infrastructure such as electric transmission there have been no deaths from carbon dioxide pipelines over the past two decades and one injury in addition to the hospitalizations from the satartia incident according to the transportation department there are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding carbon capture and storage said miklos the executive at international paper but the vicksburg project is an opportunity to carefully examine the technical and economic viability and the impact on climate over a multiyear period he said the primary questions are around the ability to do this in a way that is cost effective he said ,,2024-04-07,,Big oil is racing to scale up carbon capture to slash emissions but the challenges are

the annual twoday sec speaks event kicked off tuesday offering clues to what the priorities will be for the securities and exchange commission in the coming year sponsored by the practising law institute it is a forum where the sec provides guidance to the legal community on rules regulations enforcement actions and lawsuits the event allows the sec to get its main messages across and this year a key issue is disclosure we have an obligation to update the rules of the road always with an eye toward promoting trust as well as efficiency competition and liquidity in the markets sec chair gary gensler said in his introduction to the conference besides gensler all the sec division heads and senior staff will be speaking based on genslers introductory remarks there will be discussions about the upcoming move to shorten the securities settlement cycle from two days to one t which takes place may  the expansion of the definition of an exchange to include more recent trading platforms like requestforquote or rfq electronic trading platforms consideration of a change in the current onepenny increment for quoting stock trades to subpenny levels creation of a best execution standard for brokerdealers and creation of more competition for individual investors orders socalled payment for order flow you often hear sec officials say the role of the sec is to protect investors maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation that sounds like a pretty broad mandate and it is deliberately so it came out of the disaster of the  stock market crash which was the initial event in the greatest economic catastrophe of the last  years the great depression prior to  and particularly in the s all sorts of securities were sold to the public with wild claims behind them much of which were fraudulent after the crash of  congress went looking for a cause and fraudulent claims and lack of disclosure were high on the list congress then passed the securities act of  and the following year passed the securities exchange act of  which created the sec to enforce all the new laws it also required everyone involved in the securities business mainly brokerage firms and stock exchanges to register with the sec the  act did not make it illegal to sell a bad investment it simply required disclosure all relevant facts about an investment were supposed to be disclosed and investors could make up their own minds the  act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities in the united states this was followed by the investment company act of  which regulated mutual funds and eventually etfs and the investment advisers act of  which required investment advisers to register with the sec tuesdays conference is a chance for gensler and his staff to tell everyone what they are doing in greater detail the agency has six divisions but they can be boiled down to disclosure risk monitoring and enforcement risk monitoring disclosure theres also a division of examinations that conducts the secs national exam program its just what it sounds like the sec identifies areas of high concern cybersecurity crypto money laundering climate change etc and then monitors corporate america investment advisers investment companies brokerdealers etc to make sure they are in compliance with all the required disclosures current hot topics include climate change crypto and cybersecurity the problem is that the definition of what should be disclosed has evolved over the decades for example there is a bitter legal fight brewing over the recent enactment of regulations requiring companies to disclose climate risks many contend this was not part of the original sec mandate the sec disagrees arguing it is part of the mandate to protect investors enforcement these are the cops they conduct investigations into securities laws violations and they prosecute the civil suits in the federal courts this division will be providing an update on the litigation the sec is involved in which is growing mutual funds etfs and investment advisers trading donald trump will likely not come up at the conference but the sec in january considerably tightened the rules around disclosure of special purpose acquisition companies or spacs trumps company truth social went public on march  through a merger with a spac known as digital world acquisition corp it is now trading as prior to the recent rule changes executives marketing a company to be acquired by a spac often made wild claims about the future profitability of these businesses  claims that would never have been possible to make had a traditional initial public offering route been used the new spac rules that the sec adopted made the target company legally liable for any statement made about future results by assuming responsibility for disclosures additionally companies are provided with a safe harbor protection when they make forwardlooking statements which provide them with protection against certain legal liabilities however ipos are not afforded this safe harbor protection which is why forwardlooking statements in an ipo registration are usually very cautiously worded the rules clarified that spacs also do not have safe harbor legal protections for forwardlooking statements which means the companies could more easily be sued like i said trump will likely not come up at the conference but the message disclosure will likely be the dominant refrain correction an earlier version of this story misspelled the name of the practising law institute

beijing  chinas real estate troubles are likely far from over and industry problems need to be addressed quickly if overall gdp growth is to pick up significantly according to a report released thursday by global investment firm kkr thats one of the two key takeaways from a recent trip to china by the firms head of global and macro asset allocation henry h mcvey it was his fourth visit in just over a year a fundamentally overbuilt real estate industry needs to be addressed  and quickly he said in the report which counts changchun hua kkrs chief economist for greater china among the coauthors second confidence must be restored to drive savings back down mcvey said noting that would spur consumers and businesses to spend on upgrading to higher quality products as chinese authorities have promoted real estate and related sectors once accounted for about one fifth or more of chinas economy depending on the breadth of analysts calculations the property industry has slumped in the last few years after beijings crackdown on developers high reliance on debt for growth based on comparisons to housing corrections in the us japan and spain chinas housing market correction may be just halfway complete in terms of its depth the kkr report said both price and volume must come under pressure to finish the cleansing cycle the report said to date though it has largely been a contraction in volume while kkrs report didnt provide much detail on expectations for specific real estate policy the authors said more action by beijing to improve chinas real estate sector could materially shift investor perception amid geopolitical tensions the countrys property market slump and according to some of our proprietary survey work many allocators have considered reducing china exposure to  down from  today at a time that we think fundamentals in the economy are likely bottoming the kkr report said much of official chinese data to start the year beat analysts expectations chinese officials have said the real estate sector remains in a period of adjustment while beijing shifts its emphasis authorities have also released policies to promote financial support for select property developers while many local governments  though not necessarily the largest cities  have significantly relaxed home purchase restrictions kkr expects a modest slowdown in chinas gdp growth to  this year and  next year with real estate and covidrelated factors halving their drag on the economy from  percentage points in  to a  percentage point drag in  our bottom line is that with the ongoing property correction as well as some potential further policy support we think the drag to the overall economy should moderate a bit over the next few years mcvey said in a separate statement he is also chief investment officer of kkr balance sheet catering accommodation and wholesale are set to modestly increase their contribution to growth in the next two years while digitalization and the shift toward more carbonneutral green industry are expected to remain the largest drivers of growth according to the report for investors the report said a more important development than chinas gdp increase would be whether authorities could make it easier for businesses and households to tap capital markets repairing soft spots in the economy especially around housing will ultimately improve the cost of capital and will also allow new consumer companies to access the capital markets likely at better prices if real estate and confidence are doing better mcvey said in the statement beijing in march announced a gdp target of around  for this year minister of housing and urbanrural development ni hong said last month that developers recent data have pointed to some stabilization in the property sector slowdown the sevendaymoving average of new home sales in  major cities fell by  yearonyear as of monday better than the  drop recorded a week earlier according to nomura citing wind information compared with the same period in  that sales average was only down by  as of monday versus a  drop a week earlier nomura said noting most of the improvement was in chinas biggest cities kkr said most of its local portfolio is in consumer and services companies whose business reflect how chinese people in the middle to higher income range are spending modestly to upgrade their lifestyles top line growth is solid margins are holding and consumers are spending on less conspicuous items such as smart homes pets and recreational activities the report said domestic travel is also strong retail sales rose by a betterthanexpected  longer term kkr still expects that china can follow historical precedent in changing policy to be more investor friendly while our message is not an allclear signal to lean in the report said it is a reminder  using history as our guide  that if china does adjust its domestic policies to be more investor friendly especially as it relates to supply side reforms this market could rebound significantly from current levels ,,2024-04-07,,KKR says China's real estate correction may only be halfway done

decades of trade deficits and a strong dollar created too many losers in the us economy who turned to donald trumps protectionist policies according to richard koo chief economist at the nomura research institute  and those conditions remain trumps america first economic policies led his administration to institute a slew of trade tariffs on china mexico the european union and others including slapping  duties on imported steel and aluminum as the republican nominee for the  presidential election trump has proposed a baseline  tariff on all us imports and a minimum levy of  on imported chinese products these policies have drawn widespread criticism from economists who argue that tariffs are counterproductive as they make imported goods more expensive for the average american speaking to cnbcs steve sedgwick on the sidelines of the ambrosetti forum on friday koo said protectionism was a horrible thing but that trumps approach does have some economic logic when we studied economics and free trade in particular we were taughtthat free trade always creates both winners and losers in the same economy but the gain that winners get is always greater than the loss of the losers so the society as a whole always gains so thats why the free trade is good he noted koo nevertheless argued that this rests on the assumption that trade flows are balanced or in surplus while the us has been running huge deficits for the last forty years which have expanded the number of losers by  the number of people who consider themselves losers of free trade were large enough to elect trump president and so we have to really go back and say to ourselves what did we do wrong to allow this many people in united states to view themselves as losers of free trade he said for koo the key problem was the exchange rate as the strength of the us dollar incentivized foreign imports and hurt us companies exporting around the world we kind of let the exchange rate be decided by socalled market forces speculators my clients wall street types but the foreign exchange rate has to be set in a way that the number of losers does not grow to a point where the free trade itself is lost koo said he pointed to a similar pivotal moment in  when president ronald reagan faced the same issue of a strong dollar and rising protectionism at the time reagan responded by facilitating the plaza accord with france west germany japan and the united kingdom to depreciate the us dollar against the respective currencies of these countries through intervention in the foreign exchange market thats the kind of thing we should have been more conscious of doing instead of allowing the dollar to go wherever the market takes it and then these people who are not as fortunate as we are in the financial markets end up suffering and end up voting for mr trump koo added he argued that economists need to move beyond the idea that the trade deficit is simply down to too much investment and too few savings in the us as this means deficit can only be reduced by remaining in recession until domestic demand weakens so much that us companies can export more goods which would not be possible in a democracy koo again pointed to past dealings with japan suggesting that if the argument held that overseas companies are just filling in where us companies cannot satisfy domestic demand then the american companies fighting japanese firms in the s and s should have recorded huge profits due to excess demand but that did not actually happen its the opposite that happened so many of them went bankrupt so many losers of free trade were left in the streets because it was not savings and investment issue it was the exchange rate issue he said the dollar should have been much weaker and reagan understood that thats why he took that action president joe bidens administration has also broken from washingtons decadeslong spotlight on free trade deals and has retained any of the measures enacted under the trump administration however rather than focus on imposing new tariffs biden has instead ,,2024-04-07,,"Free trade flaws fueled Trump's rise in 2016 — and the problems remain, top economist says"

the european central bank must take its time to get interest rate cuts right and will have a clearer picture of inflationary pressures in june the institutions chief economist told cnbc a lot of evidence is accumulating but whats also fair to say is that the transition from this holding phase weve been on hold since last september since a substantial hiking cycle we do have to take our time to get that right from holding to dialing back restrictions philip lane told cnbcs steve sedgwick on thursday lane a governing council member said the euro zone central banks inflation in line with the ecbs march messaging lane said that more data was required particularly around wages and that the governing council would learn a lot by april a lot more by june  the dates of its next two meetings in a news conference after the march meeting ecb president christine lagarde said market pricing on the timing of rate cuts  which indicate a start in june as of thursday  seems to be converging better with the central banks view june emerged as a key date in market commentary as its set to mark the first meeting where the ecb can assess spring data on wage negotiations for the year asked about other colleagues on the ecbs governing council who have suggested rate cuts could take place before the summer lane said he believed this was a reference to the second quarter which would include june i think q is a time when we will be far enough into  to see more of the wage dynamic to see more of the price pressures he stressed that it was important in his own role to avoid trying to provide calendar guidance to the market once we are sufficiently confident that we will get back to target in a sustainable manner in a timely manner thats the right time to move to the next phase he said policymakers have repeatedly stressed that many of the causes of the inflationary cycle have subsided such as the energy price spike and supply chain issues but they remain concerned about domestic inflationary pressures from bank of england governor andrew bailey lane said thursday that while the ecbs forecast relied on some moderation in wage growth it was important for peoples inflationadjusted salaries to improve and that companies should shoulder lower profits to allow this to happen wages were not the source of this inflation problem but in terms of making sure we get back to target the interplay between wages and profits our forecast is built on a degree of wage deceleration he said its important to say we need to see workers real incomes improve to rebuild not just this year but the year after so we allow for higher to normal wage increases lane added but we also need to see essentially firms absorbing a fair amount of that in lower profits profits were quite high in  there is some room for profits to come down and that is part of the open questions we have ,,2024-04-07,,"European Central Bank chief economist: Must 'take our time' on rate cuts, clearer picture due in June"

beijing  chinese electric car company since november nio has partnered with at least four chinese automakers  changan geely chery and jac  for developing battery swap standards and expanding the network in china all these efforts are aimed at alleviating consumers anxiety about driving range while having a large network of battery charging stations helps address those concerns battery swapping is a faster method as it takes only a few minutes swapping right now is mainly driven by nio of course nio found out this is an ecosystem clsas deputy head of research ding luo said in an interview if only one player is trying to build up the whole ecosystem its impossible for them thats why theyre thinking whether they can invite some partners battery swapping still isnt mainstream because the car batteries need to be standardized he added while a charging station resembles a typical gas station batteryswap technology is housed in a shedlike structure it uses machines to automatically exchange depleted batteries for precharged ones in compatible cars nio said in midmarch that it completed  million battery swaps compared with nearly  million charges at its public stations  nio consumers can also access thirdparty charging stations or install one at home i think our outlook is very simple shen fei senior vice president of nios power division said in chinese translated by cnbc the first thing is to serve nios users and then provide a good battery charging and swapping experience make charging more convenient than refueling and at the same time help the company sell more cars the company claims that with battery swap drivers can get a fresh charge in three minutes if they opt in for a shen said more car models will be added to nios battery swap network while adding that swapping can allow drivers to keep abreast with improvements in battery technology power services and other products account for just about  of nios total revenue the company said that category of other sales for  grew by  to  billion yuan  million nio does not break out swap station revenue battery swapping has been tried by the industry with mixed success especially in the us tesla and a startup called better space tried out swapping more than  years ago but the venture soon closed in  another startup while its not clear how much headway ample has made in the us the company has since expanded its partnerships overseas last month the company announced it would serve for swapping to work it cant be niche tu le head of consultancy sino auto insights said battery inventory investment is massive so it needs to be amortized over lots of swapping but he was cautious on whether nio could sell enough of its own premiumpriced cars to make the economics work for now i still think the combination of swapping and charging makes for a pretty attractive feature set but swapping alone likely doesnt help them sell that many more cars i think the nudge the chinese government gave to encourage others to join forces with nio on swapping could create the necessary pool of vehicles to make swapping viable he added nio is the first major electric car company to roll out battery swap stations in addition to charging stations alongside its own vehicles in mainland china and the company has installed more than  battery swap stations and plans to install  more this year nios investment in battery swap stations is about two years ahead of market demand ceo william li said last month adding that less than a fifth of battery swap stations that nio operates are processing  orders a day likely the minimum orders needed for a station to break even nios battery charging stations on the other hand reached profitability last year according to the company it plans to build  more this year passenger car battery swap stations can cost around  to build while a relatively basic charging station with two ports costs around  to  according to shay natarajan a north americabased partner at mobility impact partners a private equity fund that invests in transportation clsas luo said businesses also prefer to invest in normal charging stations than swap stations because they make a higher return but if businesses want to install fastercharging stations he said they might face power grid challenges clsas analysis found that the power required for five superchargers in one location would be more than what  families would normally consume tesla is also collaborating with automakers in battery charging with its over  superchargers worldwide that claim to restore about twothirds of a batterys charge in  minutes in february ford reached a deal that allows its electric cars to the rapid development of electric cars ostensibly aimed at reducing carbon emissions also raises questions about battery waste nio pointed out that recent growth of new energy vehicles which include hybrids means nearly  million batteries will be reaching the end of their eightyear warranty period between  and  last month the company announced a partnership with battery giant nio claimed that by using battery swap and big data it can retain  of a batterys capacity

as legal battles over reproductive rights increase across the us one area that could be impacted is egg freezing in february the alabama state supreme court ruled that all embryos created through in vitro fertilization women who choose to undergo reproductive technology procedures such as egg freezing face a long road riddled with obstacles heres a look into the driving forces behind egg freezing and the financial social and emotional costs that come with it  based on personal experiences from women across the country theres a notion that most women delaying motherhood are doing so to focus on other aspects of their lives such as their careers thats not so much the case anymore according to marcia inhorn a professor specializing in medical anthropology at yale university the majority of women who freeze their eggs are doing it because they have not found a partner i call that the mating gap  the lack of eligible educated equal partners inhorn who last year authored the book motherhood on ice the mating gap and why women freeze their eggs told cnbc this problem stems from the fact that today women are receiving higher education at greater rates than men inhorn noted that women are outperforming men in higher education in  of countries and that in the united states alone there are  more women than men in higher education the result is that for women who are highly educated in america and of reproductive age  between  and   there literally are millions too few collegeeducated men inhorn added another reason women freeze their eggs is the sense of empowerment the procedure brings them fundamentally inhorn believes that this freedom that egg freezing allows is what ultimately draws increasingly younger women to the procedure it gives you a little reprieve a little extra time she said this statement is one that reproductive endocrinologists and fertility specialists drs nicole noyes and aimee eyvazzadeh agree with noyes who has worked in the fertility industry since  and is based in new york has seen a noticeable shift in her patients ages and attitudes in the last two decades in the beginning her patients tended to be older in their early s and viewed egg freezing as a lastditch procedure as they hedged the end of their reproductive lives now women as young as their late s come in to see noyes eyvazzadeh who has also worked in the field for  years and lives in california has noticed a trend towards younger patients who are choosing to freeze their eggs while theyre at their most viable this is the case for social media influencer serena kerrigan who just recently turned  despite being in a relationship egg freezing was a procedure she willingly undertook while focusing on growing her business she told cnbc kerrigan who has more than  followers between her instagram and tiktok and is based in new york began sharing her egg freezing journey last year she wanted to remove some of the stigma around egg freezing and give her followers an inside look at the arduous process kerrigan has paid for all her procedures on her own she told cnbc and recently partnered with her clinic spring fertility to donate a round of egg freezing to one of her followers eventually she hopes egg freezing can be less stigmatized theres a layer of shame or taboo that i actually dont understand to me this is science and this is incredible and this is a huge advancement she said this is a way of putting the power back into women and having control of their lives while the benefits of egg freezing are certainly enormous so too are the associated costs the average price for a single egg freezing cycle in the us clocks in at nutrition health coach jenny hayes edwards froze her eggs in  at  years old and was but high costs were her number one obstacle her restaurants had taken a hit after the  financial collapse when many consumers began foregoing their expensive ski vacations in colorado hayes edwards remembers it being a tough decision to make but her mother eventually helped sway her in favor of the procedure its just money and the opportunity that you might be missing is so much bigger hayes edwards recalled her mother saying i was so grateful that she pushed me over the edge she was able to scrape together the  needed through maxing out a credit card selling some jewelry and liquidating a bond in her inheritance hayes edwards now has a healthy threeyearold daughter conceived nearly a decade after she froze her eggs and is still appreciative for the extra time egg freezing bought her to meet her nowhusband in recent years egg freezing fertility and family planning services have increasingly michelle parsons decided to freeze her eggs since the procedure was offered through her job the various tech companies parsons has worked for have offered anywhere between  to  in fertility benefits parsons who is a lesbian had always known that she wanted to freeze her eggs  and undertook the procedure while working at match group as chief product officer of dating app hinge at the time neither she nor her expartner were ready to have children but it was one financial incentive parsons didnt want to miss out on besides eggs parsons also chose to freeze her successfully fertilized embryos as another backup frozen embryos have a much higher likelihood of viable thawing in fact parsons search for a sperm donor sparked one of the mostused features on the hinge app  voice prompts when we started to listen to all of these voice recordings of potential sperm donors the lightbulb went off in my head and i was like wow this is whats missing from dating right now parsons told cnbc because voice gives you so much nuance into personality humor vibe  we ended up building that feature called voice prompts on hinge and it was a huge wild success that led to rapid growth for hinge and it became viral on tiktok still parsons noticed egg freezing taking a toll on her professional and personal life in other ways you have to inject yourself with hormones for two weeks you have to eat differently you dont really want to be in social settings you cant drink there are all these other ramifications around just going through that process even though we know itll be for this one month and then itll be over she said the process also doesnt guarantee success evelyn gosnell underwent her first egg retrieval when she was  following by two additional cycles at  and  years old by the time she was ready to have children with her nowpartner the new yorkbased behavioral scientist had many frozen eggs ready but she

the swiss national bank on thursday surprised the market with a decision to lower its main policy rate by  percentage points to  saying national inflation is likely to stay below  for the foreseeable future economists polled by reuters had expected the swiss central bank to hold rates at  for some months now inflation has been back below  and thus in the range the snb equates with price stability according to the new forecast inflation is also likely to remain in this range over the next few years the bank said swiss inflation continued to fall in february hitting  the snb also reduced its annual inflation forecasts the bank now sees average inflation reaching  in  down from its  estimate in december and  for  trimmed from the previous  estimate its first forecast for  puts average inflation at  over the period following the announcement analysts at capital economics said they expect two more snb rate cuts over the course of this year with the bank sounding more dovish and inflation likely to undershoot its forecasts we think inflation will come in even lower than the new snb forecasts imply and remain around the current level of  before falling to below  next year accordingly we forecast the snb to cut rates at the september and december meetings taking the policy rate to  where we think it will remain throughout  and  capital economics analysts said in a note the september meeting is likely to be the last under the stewardship of snb chairman thomas jordan who will step down at the end of that month after  years at the helm the snb said swiss economic growth is likely to remain modest in the coming quarters with the gdp poised to expand by roughly  this year our forecast for switzerland as for the global economy is subject to significant uncertainty the main risk is weaker economic activity abroad momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets has weakened noticeably in recent quarters the snb said however the vulnerabilities in these markets remain on a macro level the snb flagged moderate global economic growth in the coming quarters along with likely falls in inflation partly thanks to restrictive monetary policy strategies it nevertheless acknowledged significant risks and geopolitical tensions that could cloud the international economic horizon in a tv interview with cnbcs silvia amaro jordan said that the improved inflation forecast has given the bank the breathing room to lower rates but refused to be drawn on the inevitability of three cuts this year we will see in june whether the situation is different whether inflationary pressure continues to decline then well make a new decision in june he said acknowledging that the bank remains ready to intercede in the foreign exchange market if necessary to defend the swiss franc high interest rates typically prop up currencies and weaken the relative value of other coins against them we said very clearly that we remain  available to intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary so we can use this instrument in order to make sure that monetary conditions remain appropriate jordan noted he fell short of commenting on whether other central banks will take a page from the snbs trailblazing book and loosen their monetary policy but signaled no concerns over the potential impact their moves may have on the swiss currency we will profit from a situation where we have price stability globally of course it could have an impact on interest rate differentials but i think a situation where the price stability is reestablished everywhere this is something that is positive for the global economy and so also for switzerland he said switzerland is the first advanced economy to cut interest rates following a prolonged period of high inflationary pressures exacerbated by the covid pandemics impact on global trade and russias war in ukraine switzerland was also affected by jitters in the banking space last year when the government stepped in to facilitate jordan on thursday stressed to cnbc the importance of liquidity to the swiss banking sector a key message from us is always that they have to prepare their collateral so that this collateral  in case they need additional liquidity he said asked whether swiss lenders are doing enough in this direction jordan said there were very good discussions in switzerland at the moment between banks and the snb the situation of march last year and also in the united states made it very clear also to smaller banks that liquidity issues could be a problem he said i think we are on the good way in order to make sure that sufficient collateral will be available in an emergency case  but its very important that we continue to go in that direction the swiss

stubbornly high inflation could push the federal reserve into a more cautious stance this year regarding interest rate cuts the central banks former vice chair said friday richard clarida who served as fed governor until january  and is now a global economic advisor at asset management giant pimco said his former colleagues need to be on guard against sticky prices that could thwart plans to ease monetary policy this year at its meeting earlier this week the ratesetting federal open market committee indicated this may be more of a hope than a forecast clarida said during an interview on cnbcs  markets also are expecting three cuts this year though that pricing has been scaled back after data to start the year showed inflation higher than expected fed officials are banking that elevated shelter inflation is on its way down paving the way to lower their key borrowing rate from its highest level in more than  years clarida however said the extent to which the fed can cut is unclear under a pretty broad range of scenarios theyre going to get at least one cut in this year he said however the calculus gets different as inflation data provides mixed signals the fed prefers the commerce departments measure of personal consumption expenditures prices with a particular focus on the core reading that excludes food and energy the headline however the more commonly followed if the fed were targeting cpi right now we wouldnt even be discussing rate cuts clarida said he also noted that even though powell on wednesday said financial conditions are tight they in fact are a lot easier than they were in november a what i think is going on here is a delicate balance that powell is trying to navigate clarida said financial conditions will very naturally start to ease when they get the sense the fed is done and will start cutting then of course that improves the economic outlook and potentially makes it harder to get inflation down to  percent ,,2024-04-07,,Former Fed Vice Chair Clarida sees possibility of fewer rate cuts than expected this year

a paper mill in a small mississippi town could help demonstrate whether capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing it deep underground is a viable path to fight climate change the proposed project at amazon the vicksburg paper mill project is just one example of how carbon capture and storage technology today is expensive logistically complex and faces controversy over its role in the energy transition and safety concerns in communities where pipeline infrastructure would be expanded the parisbased international energy agency has described carbon capture and storage as critical to achieve global netzero emissions while also warning the oil and gas industry against using the technology as a way to maintain the status quo on fossil fuels some climate activists accuse the industry of simply investing in carbon capture as way to extend the use of oil and gas the technology typically uses chemical absorption to capture carbon dioxide emitted from the chimney of an industrial plant the emissions are condensed into a fluid for transport normally through a pipeline and are stored thousands of feet below ground in depleted oil wells or geological formations such as saltwater reservoirs the challenges to implementing the technology are immense the world needs to capture more than  billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by  more than  times the  million metric tons captured in  according to the iea by  the amount of carbon thats captured needs to reach  billion tons  more than  times the  level according to the agency but the track record of carbon capture and storage so far has been one of underperformance with only  of announced projects having reached a final investment decision according to the iea the industry needs to demonstrate that the technology can operate economically at scale after struggling to ramp up deployment for years the agency says the vicksburg papermill project is still in an early development stage slb is confident that it will prove technologically viable said fred majkut senior vice president of carbon solutions at the company the goal is to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is also economically viable majkut said the economic viability of carbon capture and sequestration is a challenge today because the cost of building most plants in order to capture carbon dioxide are very significant the executive said it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit an industrial plant he said for international paper the vicksburg project is a potential way to produce lower carbon products for consumers who are climate conscious and a potential opportunity to benefit financially through the sale of carbon credits there are examples in the marketplace where customers have the opportunity to express their preferences economically whether thats clicking a button to say they want to abate the carbon emissions for a trip in an uber or an airplane said adam miklos director of low carbon innovation at international paper ultimately it has the potential to reduce our emissions and if successful present an opportunity to sell carbon and renewable credits miklos said the mississippi mill is a snapshot of how the oil and gas industry is trying to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is a viable tool in the race to slash emissions after using similar technology for decades to extract oil the industry has used carbon storage techniques since the s in a process called enhanced oil recovery in which carbon dioxide is injected underground to create pressure that pushes more crude toward production wells chevron total spending on carbon capture and storage projects is expected to reach  billion worldwide by  if all announced projects materialize according rystad energy the united states and the united kingdom are the leaders with investments expected to reach  billion and  billion respectively by the end of the decade according to rystad in the us investment in carbon management technologies more than doubled to  billion in  the first full year after the passage of the inflation reduction act according to the cement plants for example produce emissions not only by burning fossil fuels but also due to the materials used in the manufacturing process about twothirds of the industrys carbon dioxide emissions come from chemical reactions that occur when breaking down limestone cement is one of the most widelyused products globally second only to drinking water and is responsible for about  of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions alone right now these types of industries have no way to effectively decarbonize to net zero without carbon capture majkut said if they want to produce cement there will be co emissions simply because of the materials that are being used with carbon storage already a mature commercial business slb is trying to tackle the capture side which presents one of the major hurdles to scaling up the technology due to its high cost according to majkut the solvent that would be used to catch carbon dioxide molecules at the mississippi mill promises to lower the energy requirements of the capture process and make it more cost effective he said were quite comfortable that in the next  to  months we will be coming to market with actually that chemistry as part of our core offering and develop what we call process design packages majkut said slb ceo olivier le peuch has said carbon capture and storage will play a leading role in the companys annual revenue targets of  billion by  and  billion by  for its new energy portfolio slb this month announced a nearly  million investment in aker carbon capture a pureplay carbon capture company based in norway in an effort to accelerate deployment of the technology at commercial scale competitor baker hughes is developing direct air capture technology after acquiring a company called mosaic materials in  baker hughes has not disclosed the value of the deal the technology aims to catch low concentration carbon dioxide emissions which are harder to capture directly from the atmosphere as well as from industrial plants baker hughes anticipates the technology will most likely come to market by the end of  baker hughes is targeting up to  billion in orders by  for its new energy portfolio which includes carbon capture and storage technology the company is forecasting a total market for its new energy business of between  billion and  billion by the end of the decade by  i do believe were going to start to see these technologies start to become reasonably competitive said alessandro bresciani senior vice president of climate technologies at baker hughes the gulf coast of the united states home to enormous oil and gas and other industrial plants is emerging as a center of carbon capture and storage investments in the us jeff gustavson vice president of lower carbon energies at chevron said the region has the potential to quickly increase use of the technology because of favorable geology for storage located close to high concentration emissions that are easier to capture at a lower cost some  million tons of carbon dioxide are emitted annually from houston through to port arthur texas gustavson said chevron exxon over the past two years has entered agreements to capture carbon emissions from ammonia and fertilizer producer dan ammann president of low carbon solutions at exxon said those three contracts combined promise to remove  million tons of emissions annually  the equivalent of converting  million gaspowered cars to electric vehicles exxon completed its acquisition of the carbondioxide pipeline operator denbury for  billion in late  the deal gave exxon more than  miles of pipeline stretching through mississippi louisiana and texas that are located near at least  storage sites in the region it gives us sort of instantaneous scale instantaneous reach across this huge source of emissions along the gulf coast ammann said of the denbury acquisition it gives us the ability to develop storage all along that pipeline as well exxon says it now owns the largest carbon dioxide pipeline network in the us as the infrastructure comes together exxon is seeing a very high level of interest from a lot of different emitters along the gulf coast ammann said chevron is the operator and lead investor in a flagship project called bayou bend which has a  acre position of permanent carbon dioxide storage space near port arthur and beaumont texas the project is a joint venture with minority shareholders negotiations are currently underway with potential customers gustavson said declining to disclose names the area is home to large petrochemical refinery liquid natural gas and industrial gas operations with significant carbon dioxide footprints he said bayou bend could be one of the largest co storage projects in the world youre talking several million tons a year of storage gustavson said the project has the potential for even more storage capacity depending on how much technical progress is made the executive said while the iea has described carbon capture and storage as essential to slash emissions in sectors like heavy industry agency director fatih birol issued a sharply worded statement in november calling on the oil and gas industry to let go of the illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution to climate change birols comments came on the back of an were not saying carbon capture can be implemented everywhere slbs majkut said as a matter of fact the primary way to decarbonize should be energy efficiency scale up of renewables and effectively carbon capture shall be used on applications that you cant easily electrify that you cant easily decarbonize otherwise increasing carbon capture and storage to meet netzero emissions goals in the us will require a massive expansion of pipeline infrastructure the department of energy the key is the right geology close by to concentrated emissions gustavson said thats where we see this scaling fastest first but over time we will need to build more co infrastructure to be able to transport co much longer distances to access the same storage but the permitting process is challenging because pipelines often cross state lines requiring lengthy approval from multiple jurisdictions and creating bottlenecks majkut said pipeline expansion has faced opposition in communities where residents are denbury said in a the energy department says carbon dioxide pipelines have a better safety record than natural gas pipelines and other large infrastructure such as electric transmission there have been no deaths from carbon dioxide pipelines over the past two decades and one injury in addition to the hospitalizations from the satartia incident according to the transportation department there are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding carbon capture and storage said miklos the executive at international paper but the vicksburg project is an opportunity to carefully examine the technical and economic viability and the impact on climate over a multiyear period he said the primary questions are around the ability to do this in a way that is cost effective he said ,,2024-04-07,,Big oil is racing to scale up carbon capture to slash emissions but the challenges are

if you miss a doctors appointment these days you could get hit with a  this happened to me recently for the first time and the charge was a steep  when i complained to friends and family i learned that my experience wasnt unusual  most had dealt with a similar fee i talked to experts and consumer advocates about why such fees are becoming common if the charges are fair to patients and how to best avoid them i very strongly support such fees said patients who dont show up are taking up appointments which other patients could use said loewenstein adding that without such a fee patients have little if any disincentive for not bothering to cancel appointments well in advance more from personal finance certified financial planner and physician if a patient doesnt show up that costs the practice money said mcclanahan a member of caitlin donovan but she said to solve this problem is not to charge patients more fees which many cant afford she has heard of medical offices having success with call and text reminders to patients about their appointments patients should always be given the opportunity to bow out she said that doesnt always happen earlier this month my sister janna tried to call her doctor twice to cancel her appointment for the next day i was in elevator music purgatory for over  minutes she said both times she didnt get through to anyone three weeks later she got a bill for a  noshow fee for my appointment i did get a call the day before from the doctors office but when i told the woman id forgotten about the appointment and couldnt make it she said id still be charged a cancellation fee adam rust but if penalty fees become a profit center it may incentivize trickery and deception rust said in addition to sufficient reminders and opportunities to cancel appointments for patients there can be other creative alternatives to noshow fees donovan said she recently spoke to one medical group in camden new jersey that had a problem with patients standing them up they started asking people why they hadnt come many said they just didnt have reliable transportation to get there they implemented a ride share which came at a cost to the office but their attendance levels went right up and more than compensated for the cost of the rides donovan said when you make a doctors appointment ask about the offices policy around late cancellations and missed appointments donovan said if youre told youll be charged for missing an appointment ask if you can reschedule it instead you can also try asking the office if they can waive the charge if you find it unfair or if you cant afford it she said they should work with you ultimately these fees are discretionary and i would be reluctant to work with any office that inflexibly charged them donovan said on a practical note debt owed to a doctors or dentists office is considered medical debt a spokesperson for the consumer financial protection bureau told cnbc such debts that are less than  are not reported to the credit bureaus they added as a result it seems unlikely that a noshow fee would harm your credit when my sister janna got her noshow invoice she simply called the number on the bill and explained that shed tried without success to cancel her appointment the customer service agent agreed to waive the fee immediately i feel like they have a system where they send out the bill for a noshow and then if people make the effort of calling it to question it theyll get rid of it janna said but there are some people who are just going to pay it so they bank on those people ,,2024-04-07,,I was charged $150 for missing a doctor's appointment.

growth is likely to remain modest in the coming quarters with the gdp poised to expand by roughly  this year our forecast for switzerland as for the global economy is subject to significant uncertainty the main risk is weaker economic activity abroad momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets has weakened noticeably in recent quarters the snb said however the vulnerabilities in these markets remain on a macro level the snb flagged moderate global economic growth in the coming quarters along with likely falls in inflation partly thanks to restrictive monetary policy strategies it nevertheless acknowledged significant risks and geopolitical tensions that could cloud the international economic horizon in a tv interview with cnbcs silvia amaro jordan said that the improved inflation forecast has given the bank the breathing room to lower rates but refused to be drawn on the inevitability of three cuts this year we will see in june whether the situation is different whether inflationary pressure continues to decline then well make a new decision in june he said acknowledging that the bank remains ready to intercede in the foreign exchange market if necessary to defend the swiss franc high interest rates typically prop up currencies and weaken the relative value of other coins against them we said very clearly that we remain  available to intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary so we can use this instrument in order to make sure that monetary conditions remain appropriate jordan noted he fell short of commenting on whether other central banks will take a page from the snbs trailblazing book and loosen their monetary policy but signaled no concerns over the potential impact their moves may have on the swiss currency we will profit from a situation where we have price stability globally of course it could have an impact on interest rate differentials but i think a situation where the price stability is reestablished everywhere this is something that is positive for the global economy and so also for switzerland he said switzerland is the first advanced economy to cut interest rates following a prolonged period of high inflationary pressures exacerbated by the covid pandemics impact on global trade and russias war in ukraine switzerland was also affected by jitters in the banking space last year when the government stepped in to facilitate jordan on thursday stressed to cnbc the importance of liquidity to the swiss banking sector a key message from us is always that they have to prepare their collateral so that this collateral  in case they need additional liquidity he said asked whether swiss lenders are doing enough in this direction jordan said there were very good discussions in switzerland at the moment between banks and the snb the situation of march last year and also in the united states made it very clear also to smaller banks that liquidity issues could be a problem he said i think we are on the good way in order to make sure that sufficient collateral will be available in an emergency case  but its very important that we continue to go in that direction the swiss

european central bank chief christine lagarde on wednesday reiterated that policymakers will consider bringing interest rates down in june but sketched an uncertain path beyond that by june we will have a new set of projections that will confirm whether the inflation path we foresaw in our march forecast remains valid lagarde said in a speech in frankfurt the june meeting has been flagged as a potential turning point by many members of the ecbs governing council  which votes on rate moves  as it will be the first gathering for which data from spring wage negotiations will be available the ecb is on alert for data available by june will also provide more insight into the path of underlying inflation and the direction of the labor market according to lagarde if these data reveal a sufficient degree of alignment between the path of underlying inflation and our projections and assuming transmission remains strong we will be able to move into the dialling back phase of our policy cycle and make policy less restrictive she said but thereafter domestic price pressures will still be visible we expect services inflation for example to remain elevated for most of this year so there will be a period ahead where we need to confirm on an ongoing basis that the incoming data supports our inflation outlook lagardes message overall was highly positive on the path on inflation despite flagging geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing domestic price pressures unlike in the earlier phases of our policy cycle there are reasons to believe that the expected disinflationary path will continue lagarde said stressing confidence in the latest set of the euro zones central bank has held rates steady since market attention is now moving to how many rate cuts the ecb is likely to carry out over the course of this year money markets indicate three cuts taking place by december along with a potential fourth according to reuters data ,,2024-04-07,,European Central Bank’s Lagarde signals June cut but says future rate path uncertain
as legal battles over reproductive rights increase across the us one area that could be impacted is egg freezing in february the alabama state supreme court ruled that all embryos created through in vitro fertilization women who choose to undergo reproductive technology procedures such as egg freezing face a long road riddled with obstacles heres a look into the driving forces behind egg freezing and the financial social and emotional costs that come with it  based on personal experiences from women across the country theres a notion that most women delaying motherhood are doing so to focus on other aspects of their lives such as their careers thats not so much the case anymore according to marcia inhorn a professor specializing in medical anthropology at yale university the majority of women who freeze their eggs are doing it because they have not found a partner i call that the mating gap  the lack of eligible educated equal partners inhorn who last year authored the book motherhood on ice the mating gap and why women freeze their eggs told cnbc this problem stems from the fact that today women are receiving higher education at greater rates than men inhorn noted that women are outperforming men in higher education in  of countries and that in the united states alone there are  more women than men in higher education the result is that for women who are highly educated in america and of reproductive age  between  and   there literally are millions too few collegeeducated men inhorn added another reason women freeze their eggs is the sense of empowerment the procedure brings them fundamentally inhorn believes that this freedom that egg freezing allows is what ultimately draws increasingly younger women to the procedure it gives you a little reprieve a little extra time she said this statement is one that reproductive endocrinologists and fertility specialists drs nicole noyes and aimee eyvazzadeh agree with noyes who has worked in the fertility industry since  and is based in new york has seen a noticeable shift in her patients ages and attitudes in the last two decades in the beginning her patients tended to be older in their early s and viewed egg freezing as a lastditch procedure as they hedged the end of their reproductive lives now women as young as their late s come in to see noyes eyvazzadeh who has also worked in the field for  years and lives in california has noticed a trend towards younger patients who are choosing to freeze their eggs while theyre at their most viable this is the case for social media influencer serena kerrigan who just recently turned  despite being in a relationship egg freezing was a procedure she willingly undertook while focusing on growing her business she told cnbc kerrigan who has more than  followers between her instagram and tiktok and is based in new york began sharing her egg freezing journey last year she wanted to remove some of the stigma around egg freezing and give her followers an inside look at the arduous process kerrigan has paid for all her procedures on her own she told cnbc and recently partnered with her clinic spring fertility to donate a round of egg freezing to one of her followers eventually she hopes egg freezing can be less stigmatized theres a layer of shame or taboo that i actually dont understand to me this is science and this is incredible and this is a huge advancement she said this is a way of putting the power back into women and having control of their lives while the benefits of egg freezing are certainly enormous so too are the associated costs the average price for a single egg freezing cycle in the us clocks in at nutrition health coach jenny hayes edwards froze her eggs in  at  years old and was but high costs were her number one obstacle her restaurants had taken a hit after the  financial collapse when many consumers began foregoing their expensive ski vacations in colorado hayes edwards remembers it being a tough decision to make but her mother eventually helped sway her in favor of the procedure its just money and the opportunity that you might be missing is so much bigger hayes edwards recalled her mother saying i was so grateful that she pushed me over the edge she was able to scrape together the  needed through maxing out a credit card selling some jewelry and liquidating a bond in her inheritance hayes edwards now has a healthy threeyearold daughter conceived nearly a decade after she froze her eggs and is still appreciative for the extra time egg freezing bought her to meet her nowhusband in recent years egg

group as chief product officer of dating app hinge at the time neither she nor her expartner were ready to have children but it was one financial incentive parsons didnt want to miss out on besides eggs parsons also chose to freeze her successfully fertilized embryos as another backup frozen embryos have a much higher likelihood of viable thawing in fact parsons search for a sperm donor sparked one of the mostused features on the hinge app  voice prompts when we started to listen to all of these voice recordings of potential sperm donors the lightbulb went off in my head and i was like wow this is whats missing from dating right now parsons told cnbc because voice gives you so much nuance into personality humor vibe  we ended up building that feature called voice prompts on hinge and it was a huge wild success that led to rapid growth for hinge and it became viral on tiktok still parsons noticed egg freezing taking a toll on her professional and personal life in other ways you have to inject yourself with hormones for two weeks you have to eat differently you dont really want to be in social settings you cant drink there are all these other ramifications around just going

stubbornly high inflation could push the federal reserve into a more cautious stance this year regarding interest rate cuts the central banks former vice chair said friday richard clarida who served as fed governor until january  and is now a global economic advisor at asset management giant pimco said his former colleagues need to be on guard against sticky prices that could thwart plans to ease monetary policy this year at its meeting earlier this week the ratesetting federal open market committee indicated this may be more of a hope than a forecast clarida said during an interview on cnbcs  markets also are expecting three cuts this year though that pricing has been scaled back after data to start the year showed inflation higher than expected fed officials are banking that elevated shelter inflation is on its way down paving the way to lower their key borrowing rate from its highest level in more than  years clarida however said the extent to which the fed can cut is unclear under a pretty broad range of scenarios theyre going to get at least one cut in this year he said however the calculus gets different as inflation data provides mixed signals the fed prefers the commerce departments measure of personal consumption expenditures prices with a particular focus on the core reading that excludes food and energy the headline however the more commonly followed if the fed were targeting cpi right now we wouldnt even be discussing rate cuts clarida said he also noted that even though powell on wednesday said financial conditions are tight they in fact are a lot easier than they were in november a what i think is going on here is a delicate balance that powell is trying to navigate clarida said financial conditions will very naturally start to ease when they get the sense the fed is done and will start cutting then of course that improves the economic outlook and potentially makes it harder to get inflation down to  percent ,,2024-04-07,,Former Fed Vice Chair Clarida sees possibility of fewer rate cuts than expected this year

new cars today are loaded with hightech features for car shoppers but with those advancements come questions about as much advancement as we have when it comes to new features many of them are data dependent he said whether its through a almost every new vehicle collects different types of details about you  and they will share and sell that data according to a more from personal finance most of the reviewed brands  share personal data with service providers data brokers and other parties not named the report found about  or  of the consulted brands said they sell customer data to third parties only two car brands currently allow users to delete their personal data mozilla found renault and dacia this is still kind of the wild wild west of data collection and aggregation said theresa payton the founder president and chief executive officer of fortalice solutions a cybersecurity advisory firm there are several challenges that remain in place for consumers she said as drivers try to find the best car that fits within their budgets and their own privacy concerns to be sure data collected by cars nowadays may not be too different from that shared from the cellphones already in our pocket said tom mcparland a contributing writer for automotive website jalopnik and operator of vehiclebuying service automatch consulting said drury think about how you use your phone theres a lot of stuff that people dont realize that theyve already given up when it comes to data while it remains to be difficult to do your own research there are three steps car shoppers can take as they assess potential new cars experts say once you narrow your options down to a specific vehicle the first thing you can do is talk to the dealership and see what insight they can give you on that brands data collection practices experts say you can ask representatives at the dealership about a carmakers privacy policies and if you have the ability to optin or optout of data collection data aggregation and data monetization  or the selling of your data to thirdparty vendors said payton additionally ask if you can be anonymized and not have the data aggregated under your name and your vehicles unique identifying number she said people at the dealership might even point you towards talking to the service manager who often has to deal with any repairs and any follow up and technical components said drury your service provider or the service adviser is actually going to have a little more insight versus the salesperson he said it may also be worthwhile to ask your auto insurance provider about car data collection said drury auto insurers may be receiving data of this nature as automakers share or sell it while people at the dealership will have some knowledge on a specific vehicle the insurance provider might give a better holistic view of it because theyre covering many different makes and models he said id ask the insurance company are you using this and do you have an option to opt in or opt out different devices to monitor said drury these days many newer vehicles essentially have an onboard computer if you dont want to be tracked or have vehicle data collected and shared you might find instructions in your owners manual on how to wipe out your personalized data and information from the onboard computer said payton that can be a great way if you are already in a car and you love the car but you dont like the data tracking she said while you may not know if the data was already collected and sent out to third parties you could do this on a periodic basis she said some separate online tools might also help an online resource called privacycars can help users delete personal data stored by automakers including text messages and geolocations payton said they are providing this tool to help users understand the data their cars collect and to give them an option to safeguard their privacy she said in a recent episode from the new york times the daily podcast a woman paid a mechanic  to remove the device in her vehicle that provided internet connectivity she essentially while it may be possible to isolate and remove a car part or chip like this you cant just rip out a cpu of a car said mcparland almost everything nowadays is going to have these integrated systems he said drury agreed these systems are so integrated with everything that your vehicles doing the sensors  that help with a vehicles semiautonomous features those are wired to your throttle to your steering to your breaks it can be extremely dangerous for somebody to go around there and start unplugging things drivers can always tap into the older used car market to find a vehicle without hightech features but such cars might have their own risks the older they are said mcparland additionally the cars onboard computer can provide a lot of safety features like car alerts said payton if you were to ostensibly turn off the onboard computer you might miss out its finding that

social security beneficiaries who owe money to the social security administration may see much lower default withholding rates from their monthly checks thanks to as of march  the social security administration instead the agency will collect either  of a beneficiarys total monthly benefit or   whichever is greater but there may be a short period where beneficiaries are still affected by the old policy the agency announced friday if that happens affected beneficiaries should call the social security administration at  more from personal finance the new rules apply to overpayments which are triggered when the amount of benefits due is miscalculated and checks are sent for higher sums than what beneficiaries are owed when that happens the social security administration is required by law to seek repayment of the excess money paid to beneficiaries but it might not be clear that an overpayment has happened for years sometimes resulting in overpayment notices for tens of thousands of dollars in recent years the problem with overpayments has become worse said david camp ceo at the national organization of social security claimants representatives there were always far too many overpayments camp said as the agency has struggled over the years with limited or outdated resources although in the last few years its been a steady though shockingly high sum total of overpaid individuals supplemental security income or ssi beneficiaries who face strict limits on their income and assets are particularly vulnerable to overpayment issues camp said the social security administration said it is working to curb the burden to affected beneficiaries we are no longer going to have that clawback cruelty of intercepting  of a payment if people do not respond to our notice commissioner martin omalley said during recent testimony before the senate while the new repayment threshold applies to new overpayments beneficiaries who currently have an overpayment withholding rate greater than  can contact the social security administration to have that lowered the agency said all affected beneficiaries should call the agency about the  repayment rate camp said but they need to approach the process with patience the social security administration does not have enough staff to answer a high volume of calls so beneficiaries should expect a hold time camp said as well as processing time the social security administration is also implementing other new policies to address overpayments including shifting the burden of proof away from social security claimants when determining who is at fault for the error the maximum time for repayment plans is being extended to  months up from  months it will also be easier for beneficiaries to request a waiver so they dont have to pay back the sums the great majority of claimants never request a waiver although many of them could qualify camp said thats particularly true for beneficiaries who are struggling to meet their basic needs or who are at risk of being evicted because they are repaying social security he said claimants ought to know that they can also ask for not having to pay it back at all if it wasnt their fault and they cant afford to repay camp said to request a waiver a beneficiary must since omalley was sworn in as commissioner in december he has taken some very aggressive steps toward addressing the overpayment issues that vex beneficiaries said max richtman president and ceo of the national committee to preserve social security and medicare theyre so reasonable it makes you wonder why no one did it before said richtman referring especially to the end of the policy of withholding all of a beneficiarys monthly payments until the entire overpaid sum is repaid thats a huge burden on most beneficiaries who live on social security or the majority of their income is social security richtman said ,,2024-04-07,,Here's what beneficiaries need to know as the Social Security Administration phases in new policies for overpayments

the annual twoday sec speaks event kicked off tuesday offering clues to what the priorities will be for the securities and exchange commission in the coming year sponsored by the practising law institute it is a forum where the sec provides guidance to the legal community on rules regulations enforcement actions and lawsuits the event allows the sec to get its main messages across and this year a key issue is disclosure we have an obligation to update the rules of the road always with an eye toward promoting trust as well as efficiency competition and liquidity in the markets sec chair gary gensler said in his introduction to the conference besides gensler all the sec division heads and senior staff will be speaking based on genslers introductory remarks there will be discussions about the upcoming move to shorten the securities settlement cycle from two days to one t which takes place may  the expansion of the definition of an exchange to include more recent trading platforms like requestforquote or rfq electronic trading platforms consideration of a change in the current onepenny increment for quoting stock trades to subpenny levels creation of a best execution standard for brokerdealers and creation of more competition for individual investors orders socalled payment for order flow you often hear sec officials say the role of the sec is to protect investors maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation that sounds like a pretty broad mandate and it is deliberately so it came out of the disaster of the  stock market crash which was the initial event in the greatest economic catastrophe of the last  years the great depression prior to  and particularly in the s all sorts of securities were sold to the public with wild claims behind them much of which were fraudulent after the crash of  congress went looking for a cause and fraudulent claims and lack of disclosure were high on the list congress then passed the securities act of  and the following year passed the securities exchange act of  which created the sec to enforce all the new laws it also required everyone involved in the securities business mainly brokerage firms and stock exchanges to register with the sec the  act did not make it illegal to sell a bad investment it simply required disclosure all relevant facts about an investment were supposed to be disclosed and investors could make up their own minds the  act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities in the united states this was followed by the investment company act of  which regulated mutual funds and eventually etfs and the investment advisers act of  which required investment advisers to register with the sec tuesdays conference is a chance for gensler and his staff to tell everyone what they are doing in greater detail the agency has six divisions but they can be boiled down to disclosure risk monitoring and enforcement risk monitoring disclosure theres also a division of examinations that conducts the secs national exam program its just what it sounds like the sec identifies areas of high concern cybersecurity crypto money laundering climate change etc and then monitors corporate america investment advisers investment companies brokerdealers etc to make sure they are in compliance with all the required disclosures current hot topics include climate change crypto and cybersecurity the problem is that the definition of what should be disclosed has evolved over the decades for example there is a bitter legal fight brewing over the recent enactment of regulations requiring companies to disclose climate risks many contend this was not part of the original sec mandate the sec disagrees arguing it is part of the mandate to protect investors enforcement these are the cops they conduct investigations into securities laws violations and they prosecute the civil suits in the federal courts this division will be providing an update on the litigation the sec is involved in which is growing mutual funds etfs and investment advisers trading donald trump will likely not come up at the conference but the sec in january considerably tightened the rules around disclosure of special purpose acquisition companies or spacs trumps company truth social went public on march  through a merger with a spac known as digital world acquisition corp it is now trading as prior to the recent rule changes executives marketing a company to be acquired by a spac often made wild claims about the future profitability of these businesses  claims that would never have been possible to make had a traditional initial public offering route been used the new spac rules that the sec adopted made the target company legally liable for any statement made about future results by assuming responsibility for disclosures additionally companies are provided with a safe harbor protection when they make forwardlooking statements which provide them with protection against certain legal liabilities however ipos are not afforded this safe harbor protection which is why forwardlooking statements in an ipo registration are usually very cautiously worded the rules clarified that spacs also do not have safe harbor legal protections for forwardlooking statements which means the companies could more easily be sued like i said trump will likely not come up at the conference but the message disclosure will likely be the dominant refrain correction an earlier version of this story misspelled the name of the practising law institute

beijing  chinas real estate troubles are likely far from over and industry problems need to be addressed quickly if overall gdp growth is to pick up significantly according to a report released thursday by global investment firm kkr thats one of the two key takeaways from a recent trip to china by the firms head of global and macro asset allocation henry h mcvey it was his fourth visit in just over a year a fundamentally overbuilt real estate industry needs to be addressed  and quickly he said in the report which counts changchun hua kkrs chief economist for greater china among the coauthors second confidence must be restored to drive savings back down mcvey said noting that would spur consumers and businesses to spend on upgrading to higher quality products as chinese authorities have promoted real estate and related sectors once accounted for about one fifth or more of chinas economy depending on the breadth of analysts calculations the property industry has slumped in the last few years after beijings crackdown on developers high reliance on debt for growth based on comparisons to housing corrections in the us japan and spain chinas housing market correction may be just halfway complete in terms of its depth the kkr report said both price and volume must come under pressure to finish the cleansing cycle the report said to date though it has largely been a contraction in volume while kkrs report didnt provide much detail on expectations for specific real estate policy the authors said more action by beijing to improve chinas real estate sector could materially shift investor perception amid geopolitical tensions the countrys property market slump and according to some of our proprietary survey work many allocators have considered reducing china exposure to  down from  today at a time that we think fundamentals in the economy are likely bottoming the kkr report said much of official chinese data to start the year beat analysts expectations chinese officials have said the real estate sector remains in a period of adjustment while beijing shifts its emphasis authorities have also released policies to promote financial support for select property developers while many local governments  though not necessarily the largest cities  have significantly relaxed home purchase restrictions kkr expects a modest slowdown in chinas gdp growth to  this year and  next year with real estate and covidrelated factors halving their drag on the economy from  percentage points in  to a  percentage point drag in  our bottom line is that with the ongoing property correction as well as some potential further policy support we think the drag to the overall economy should moderate a bit over the next few years mcvey said in a separate statement he is also chief investment officer of kkr balance sheet catering accommodation and wholesale are set to modestly increase their contribution to growth in the next two years while digitalization and the shift toward more carbonneutral green industry are expected to remain the largest drivers of growth according to the report for investors the report said a more important development than chinas gdp increase would be whether authorities could make it easier for businesses and households to tap capital markets repairing soft spots in the economy especially around housing will ultimately improve the cost of capital and will also allow new consumer companies to access the capital markets likely at better prices if real estate and confidence are doing better mcvey said in the statement beijing in march announced a gdp target of around  for this year minister of housing and urbanrural development ni hong said last month that developers recent data have pointed to some stabilization in the property sector slowdown the sevendaymoving average of new home sales in  major cities fell by  yearonyear as of monday better than the  drop recorded a week earlier according to nomura citing wind information compared with the same period in  that sales average was only down by  as of monday versus a  drop a week earlier nomura said noting most of the improvement was in chinas biggest cities kkr said most of its local portfolio is in consumer and services companies whose business reflect how chinese people in the middle to higher income range are spending modestly to upgrade their lifestyles top line growth is solid margins are holding and consumers are spending on less conspicuous items such as smart homes pets and recreational activities the report said domestic travel is also strong retail sales rose by a betterthanexpected  longer term kkr still expects that china can follow historical precedent in changing policy to be more investor friendly while our message is not an allclear signal to lean in the report said it is a reminder  using history as our guide  that if china does adjust its domestic policies to be more investor friendly especially as it relates to supply side reforms this market could rebound significantly from current levels ,,2024-04-07,,KKR says China's real estate correction may only be halfway done

beijing  chinese electric car company since november nio has partnered with at least four chinese automakers  changan geely chery and jac  for developing battery swap standards and expanding the network in china all these efforts are aimed at alleviating consumers anxiety about driving range while having a large network of battery charging stations helps address those concerns battery swapping is a faster method as it takes only a few minutes swapping right now is mainly driven by nio of course nio found out this is an ecosystem clsas deputy head of research ding luo said in an interview if only one player is trying to build up the whole ecosystem its impossible for them thats why theyre thinking whether they can invite some partners battery swapping still isnt mainstream because the car batteries need to be standardized he added while a charging station resembles a typical gas station batteryswap technology is housed in a shedlike structure it uses machines to automatically exchange depleted batteries for precharged ones in compatible cars nio said in midmarch that it completed  million battery swaps compared with nearly  million charges at its public stations  nio consumers can also access thirdparty charging stations or install one at home i think our outlook is very simple shen fei senior vice president of nios power division said in chinese translated by cnbc the first thing is to serve nios users and then provide a good battery charging and swapping experience make charging more convenient than refueling and at the same time help the company sell more cars the company claims that with battery swap drivers can get a fresh charge in three minutes if they opt in for a shen said more car models will be added to nios battery swap network while adding that swapping can allow drivers to keep abreast with improvements in battery technology power services and other products account for just about  of nios total revenue the company said that category of other sales for  grew by  to  billion yuan  million nio does not break out swap station revenue battery swapping has been tried by the industry with mixed success especially in the us tesla and a startup called better space tried out swapping more than  years ago but the venture soon closed in  another startup while its not clear how much headway ample has made in the us the company has since expanded its partnerships overseas last month the company announced it would serve for swapping to work it cant be niche tu le head of consultancy sino auto insights said battery inventory investment is massive so it needs to be amortized over lots of swapping but he was cautious on whether nio could sell enough of its own premiumpriced cars to make the economics work for now i still think the combination of swapping and charging makes for a pretty attractive feature set but swapping alone likely doesnt help them sell that many more cars i think the nudge the chinese government gave to encourage others to join forces with nio on swapping could create the necessary pool of vehicles to make swapping viable he added nio is the first major electric car company to roll out battery swap stations in addition to charging stations alongside its own vehicles in mainland china and the company has installed more than  battery swap stations and plans to install  more this year nios investment in battery swap stations is about two years ahead of market demand ceo william li said last month adding that less than a fifth of battery swap stations that nio operates are processing  orders a day likely the minimum orders needed for a station to break even nios battery charging stations on the other hand reached profitability last year according to the company it plans to build  more this year passenger car battery swap stations can cost around  to build while a relatively basic charging station with two ports costs around  to  according to shay natarajan a north americabased partner at mobility impact partners a private equity fund that invests in transportation clsas luo said businesses also prefer to invest in normal charging stations than swap stations because they make a higher return but if businesses want to install fastercharging stations he said they might face power grid challenges clsas analysis found that the power required for five superchargers in one location would be more than what  families would normally consume tesla is also collaborating with automakers in battery charging with its over  superchargers worldwide that claim to restore about twothirds of a batterys charge in  minutes in february ford reached a deal that allows its electric cars to the rapid development of electric cars ostensibly aimed at reducing carbon emissions also raises questions about battery waste nio pointed out that recent growth of new energy vehicles which include hybrids means nearly  million batteries will be reaching the end of their eightyear warranty period between  and  last month the company announced a partnership with battery giant nio claimed that by using battery swap and big data it can retain  of a batterys capacity

decades of trade deficits and a strong dollar created too many losers in the us economy who turned to donald trumps protectionist policies according to richard koo chief economist at the nomura research institute  and those conditions remain trumps america first economic policies led his administration to institute a slew of trade tariffs on china mexico the european union and others including slapping  duties on imported steel and aluminum as the republican nominee for the  presidential election trump has proposed a baseline  tariff on all us imports and a minimum levy of  on imported chinese products these policies have drawn widespread criticism from economists who argue that tariffs are counterproductive as they make imported goods more expensive for the average american speaking to cnbcs steve sedgwick on the sidelines of the ambrosetti forum on friday koo said protectionism was a horrible thing but that trumps approach does have some economic logic when we studied economics and free trade in particular we were taughtthat free trade always creates both winners and losers in the same economy but the gain that winners get is always greater than the loss of the losers so the society as a whole always gains so thats why the free trade is good he noted koo nevertheless argued that this rests on the assumption that trade flows are balanced or in surplus while the us has been running huge deficits for the last forty years which have expanded the number of losers by  the number of people who consider themselves losers of free trade were large enough to elect trump president and so we have to really go back and say to ourselves what did we do wrong to allow this many people in united states to view themselves as losers of free trade he said for koo the key problem was the exchange rate as the strength of the us dollar incentivized foreign imports and hurt us companies exporting around the world we kind of let the exchange rate be decided by socalled market forces speculators my clients wall street types but the foreign exchange rate has to be set in a way that the number of losers does not grow to a point where the free trade itself is lost koo said he pointed to a similar pivotal moment in  when president ronald reagan faced the same issue of a strong dollar and rising protectionism at the time reagan responded by facilitating the plaza accord with france west germany japan and the united kingdom to depreciate the us dollar against the respective currencies of these countries through intervention in the foreign exchange market thats the kind of thing we should have been more conscious of doing instead of allowing the dollar to go wherever the market takes it and then these people who are not as fortunate as we are in the financial markets end up suffering and end up voting for mr trump koo added he argued that economists need to move beyond the idea that the trade deficit is simply down to too much investment and too few savings in the us as this means deficit can only be reduced by remaining in recession until domestic demand weakens so much that us companies can export more goods which would not be possible in a democracy koo again pointed to past dealings with japan suggesting that if the argument held that overseas companies are just filling in where us companies cannot satisfy domestic demand then the american companies fighting japanese firms in the s and s should have recorded huge profits due to excess demand but that did not actually happen its the opposite that happened so many of them went bankrupt so many losers of free trade were left in the streets because it was not savings and investment issue it was the exchange rate issue he said the dollar should have been much weaker and reagan understood that thats why he took that action president joe bidens administration has also broken from washingtons decadeslong spotlight on free trade deals and has retained any of the measures enacted under the trump administration however rather than focus on imposing new tariffs biden has instead ,,2024-04-07,,"Free trade flaws fueled Trump's rise in 2016 — and the problems remain, top economist says"

managing ones personal finances can seem like a hodgepodge of neverending checklists and rules of thumb with all sorts of financial considerations vying for attention  here are some of the biggest financial blind spots according to several certified financial planners on cnbcs digital financial consumers often dont understand the importance of their the score impacts how easily consumers can get a loan  like a mortgage credit card or auto loan  and the interest rate they pay on that debt the number generally ranges from  to  credit agencies like equifax experian and transunion determine the score using a formula that accounts for lenders are generally more willing to give loans and better interest rates to borrowers with credit scores in the mid to highs or above lets say a consumer wants a  fixed mortgage for a year term the average person with a credit score between  and  would get a  interest rate according to national fico data as of april  by comparison someone with a score of  to  would get an  rate the latters monthly payment would cost  more relative to the person with a better credit score  amounting to an extra  over the life of the loan according to ficos wills are basic they spell out who gets your money after you die wills can also stipulate who will take care of your kids and oversee your money until your children turn  planning for such a grim event isnt fun  but its essential said barry glassman cfp founder and president of glassman wealth services im shocked by the number of welltodo families with kids who have no will in place glassman said without such a legal document state courts taking it a step further individuals can create trusts which can assign more control over details like the age at which children gain access to inherited funds glassman said choosing how much money to stash away for a one household might need three months of savings while another might need a year she said emergency funds include money to cover the necessities  like mortgage rent utility and grocery payments  in the event of an unexpected event like job loss a single person should generally try to save at least six months worth of emergency expenses elliott said thats also true for married couples where both spouses work at the same company or in the same industry the risk of a job loss occurring at or around the same time is relatively high elliott said meanwhile a couple in which the spouses make a similar income but work in different fields and occupations may only need three months of expenses if something unexpected happens to one spouses employment the odds are good that the couple can temporarily lean on the other spouses income she said business owners should aim to have at least a year of expenses saved since their income can fluctuate as the covid pandemic showed elliott added tax withholding is a payasyougo system employers estimate your annual tax bill and withhold tax from each paycheck accordingly ten out of  people couldnt explain how the tax withholding system works said ted jenkin cfp ceo and founder of oxygen financial based in atlanta employers partly base those withholdings on information workers supply on a w form generally taxpayers who get a refund during tax season withheld too much from their paychecks throughout the year they receive those overpayments from the government via a refund however those who owe money to uncle sam didnt withhold enough to satisfy their annual tax bill and must make up the difference people who owe money often blame their accountants or tax software instead of themselves even though they can generally control how much is withheld jenkin said someone who owes more than  to  may want to change their withholding jenkin said that goes for someone who gets a big refund as well instead they may wish to save and earn interest on that extra cash throughout the year jenkin said workers can fill out a new w form to change their withholding they may wish to do so upon any major life event like a marriage divorce or birth of a child to avoid surprises come tax time i think people underestimate how much money theyre going to need in retirement elliott said many people assume their spending will decline when they retire perhaps to roughly  to  of spending during their working years she said but thats not always the case yes maybe the kids are out of the house but now that youre retired you have more time meaning you have more time to do things elliott said she asks clients to envision how they want to spend their lives in retirement  travel and hobbies for example  to estimate how their spending might change that helps guide overall savings goals households also dont often account for the potential need for longterm care which can be costly in their calculations she said ,,2024-04-07,,"Here are some big money blind spots you need to avoid, advisors say"
a global gold rush is underway for a longoverlooked resource that advocates say could play a significant role in the geologic hydrogen sometimes referred to as white gold or natural hydrogen refers to hydrogen gas that is found in its natural form beneath earths surface it is hydrogen has green hydrogen a process that involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity is one exception from whats known as the hydrogen its within this context that momentum has been building around geologic hydrogen exploratory efforts are now underway in countries such as the us canada australia france spain colombia south korea and others research the consulting firm which described the pursuit of geologic hydrogen as a white gold rush said the hype stems from hopes that the untapped resource could be a gamechanger in the clean energy transition i would say this is something relatively old and new in a way minh khoi le head of hydrogen research at rystad energy told cnbc via videoconference the first project that found hydrogen was a while ago but it never picked up from there right people never seriously tried to go for exploration the almost two decades later subsequent exploration at the site last year researchers geoffrey ellis a research geologist at the energy resources program of the us geological survey usgs told cnbc that there could be a vast amount of naturally occurring hydrogen buried in underground reservoirs around the world based on current understanding ellis said there is likely to be about  trillion metric tons of geologic hydrogen in earths interior although most of this is likely to be too deep or too far offshore to be economically recovered nonetheless ellis said that just a few percent of geologic hydrogen recovery might well be enough to supply all projected demand for  years the potential is there but weve got to do the work ellis said via videoconference adding that more investment is necessary to accelerate earlystage research and development the us department of energy last month natural hydrogen has created a lot of excitement at the moment but in terms of potential i think it is still a little bit uncertain because none of these projects have actually started producing or extracting hydrogen  except for that one in mali rystad energys le told cnbc le said there were still a lot of question marks around the whole story about natural hydrogen but there appeared to be some substance behind the hype if some of these numbers that certain institutes like the usgs about the potential volume that you can extract  come true it can actually play quite a significant role he added not everyones convinced some have expressed skepticism about the clean energy potential of natural hydrogen sometimes we want to run before we can walk ana maria jallermakarewicz an energy analyst at the institute for energy economics and financial analysis told cnbc via videoconference the first nearterm priority for hydrogen jallermakarewicz said should be looking for ways to replace socalled grey hydrogen with green hydrogen grey hydrogen  dont confuse the idea of we need to find the solution with the reality jallermakarewicz said separately the hydrogen science coalition a group of academics scientists and engineers seeking to bring an evidencebased view to hydrogens role in the energy transition whats more the coalition says there are environmental concerns about the extraction process and transportation and distribution challenges mean geologic hydrogen is not likely to be found where it is needed most considering findings to date what we know about geologic hydrogen systems and the fact that favourable settings appear rare the odds of finding geologic hydrogen that can be extracted at the scale of large natural gas developments looks relatively slim the coalition said on march  ,,2024-04-07,,A global gold rush for buried hydrogen is underway — as hype builds over its clean energy potential
a quiet revolution is underway to address a widely underestimated local authorities have appointed several chief heat officers chos in cities worldwide in recent years to prepare residents for they call it the silent killer said eleni myrivili who serves as the global cho for the uns human settlement program and previously worked in a similar role for the greek capital of athens myrivili said she believes that extreme heat is often overlooked heat i believe it to the bottom of my heart is going to be the number one public health challenge that we will be dealing with in the next decade and we need to prepare for it now myrivili told cnbc via videoconference we can  but we really need to make it a priority heat is the the cdc older adults young children and people with chronic diseases are recognized as among the most at risk of heatrelated illnesses such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke the cdc warns that even young and healthy people can be affected the first person in the world

for extreme heat helping to cool homes affordably and working to cool community neighborhoods to tackle the socalled  in practice gilbert said the measures included broadscale marketing campaigns targeting the zip codes and demographics known to be most at risk working with the national weather service and emergency management teams to update advisory and warning levels they also involved installing  efficient ac units in public housing and ensuring that new affordable housing requires the most efficient cooling systems such as cool and solarready roofs to keep utility costs down we want to address the root cause of this problem while were helping people adapt gilbert said all of us here have grown up in a typically hot and humid environment we are used to the heat so that makes it really hard to distinguish between normal heat and unsafe heat bushra afreen cho for dhaka north in bangladesh told cnbc via videoconference afreen who became dhaka norths cho in may last year said stark income inequality in the countrys largest city meant excessive heat was not a universally similar experience when you combine that with fragile urban systems like drainage and power outages and poor health management and poor health systems and poor education systems you get a very bad stew alongside planting thousands of trees in dhaka norths informal settlements and reintroducing a culture of water fountains in the city afreen said her team would roll out a pilot project in one city settlement to create green nooks and corners for reprieve afreen said it would be important to consider the type of trees to plant such as citrus or neem trees to ward off mosquitoes right now the two reactions that were seeing most are good job keep it up we need more awareness afreen said and the other kind is oh youre going to decrease the heat good luck tiffany crawford cocho of melbourne told cnbc that extreme heat kills more people in australia than bushfires floods and storms theres a reason for that and its the lag in the data she said crawford who works alongside krista milne as chos of melbourne said the true scale of heatrelated deaths and illnesses often doesnt became clear until health authorities have pored through hospital admissions and ambulance data with a population of roughly  million the southeastern australian city of melbourne is known for its mild and temperate climate  but crawford says it is prone to spates of summer heatwaves that last for several days and offer scant reprieve through the night theres an extreme northerly wind blows that is just ferocious i liken it to going outside and its like someone left the oven door open or the heater on all night and forgot to turn it off crawford said some of the shortterm interventions that have been put into place in melbourne include extending public library and pool hours and rolling out socalled cool kits which contain water bottles neck towels and oldfashioned fans looking ahead crawford said the city was in conversation with google to provide constituents with socalled onlinemapped cool routes which help users navigate the city by taking advantage of existing shade or canopy cover in places like europe the dialogue in the media is a bit different the heat is shocking whereas in australia the heat is something that was consistently lived with and we will continue to live with it but it is those variables like any climate response they are becoming more and more pronounced crawford said we need to plan around that ,,2024-04-07,,"From Miami to Melbourne, a quiet revolution is

the idea of using preassembled components in housebuilding is modern techenabled versions of modular housing promise a faster more sustainable solution to housing crises according to experts but the sector has seen better adoption in some countries compared to others where it has failed to scale  such as the uk prefabrication has existed in many forms from the fast forward a century and entire modules can be built in factories to then be combined to create houses in the fact that modular housing is also made in a controlled factory environment means less waste is generated while also resulting in more building entire sections in one place also means fewer delivery trips to sites shepherd explained a  another study by academics at the university of cambridge and edinburgh napier university published in  found that modular home construction can result in despite these benefits the sector has seen a number of setbacks in recent years and it remains relatively nascent in the uk and us in january it was reported that uk firm modulous had jonatan pinkse professor of sustainable business at kings college london highlighted that part of the challenge for modular construction firms is that they first have to spend money on building a factory in which to construct modules and then need to have the projects in the pipeline to pay for this investment he suggested that this presented more difficulty when coupled with the headwinds that also affected the wider construction sector including higher energy costs and interest rates as well as a costofliving crisis in many nations prompting people to hold off on house buying and if you then cant profit from a market that is actually going up but instead is going down then the problem is simply that firms cant earn back their money fast enough and investors then lose their trust in the business model pinkse told cnbc pinkse was one of the coauthors on suzanne peters who also coauthored the research and is a research associate at alliance manchester business school told cnbc that the construction sector more broadly is a very tough business with a higher amount of failures versus other industries provisional similarly daniel paterson director of government affairs at make uk modular said that the modular housing sector had faced a series of unfortunate events as the industry had essentially only launched in the uk in its current format in  he explained that firms then need around  months to build factories meaning it wasnt long before the covid pandemic hit along with the economic headwinds that followed perceptions based on previous versions of prefabrication was another issue according to richard valentineselsey head of european living research and consultancy at savills research he told cnbc that in the uk there is the s hangover from prefabrication and the kind of connotations that has with lower quality things that dont last and all the kind of negative impacts of that from the building boom postwar in addition he said that the construction industry is quite a conservative beast and finds it very challenging at times to change and think forward and innovate unless their forced to do it which has kind of led to flirtation with new methods but no kind of wholesale change towards delivering using modular sweden and japan are the countries cited as by comparison a make uk modular in sweden one of the major players in this space is boklok which is jointly owned by construction firm skanska and homes and furniture company ikea and has been around since the mids shepherd pointed out that sweden is also not a country where you can build  months of the year they have very deep winters with limited daylight so there is an incentive to look at an alternative construction process to keep people working all year to get houses delivered at the volume needed he explained valentineselsey said that in japan there was also a difference in the approach to residential buildings in japan the value of the building depreciates over about  years so by the end of that you kind of knock it down and rebuild it because it is worthless he explained making new building methods useful given that the delivery of new homes is higher looking at these examples could methods such as modular help tackle the uks affordable housing shortage the current uk government has the target of building  homes a year but thats  houses a year and there is zero chance  of that happening if there is not some form different approach adopted shepherd said looking ahead valentineselsey said he was an optimist in his outlook for the modular sector i think were probably going to see an uptake again over the next five to  years he said however he believed that greater adoption of other types of mmc such as panelized solutions was more likely but thought modular will form part of that new mix of delivery ,,2024-04-07,,Modular homes were hailed as a solution to housing crises.

in this article a car loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot but electric vehicles are taking this adage to a new level thats becoming a major barrier to wider adoption according to some industry and investment experts a recent while lower used ev prices could increase their desirability to some buyers they can also reduce demand for new electric vehicles according to karl brauer executive analyst at iseecars the value a new car loses in the first few years is the single most expensive aspect of owning a new vehicle he said explaining that as more new car shoppers become aware of the massive drop in ev values they will be less interested in buying one speaking to cnbcs street signs asia on monday david kuo stock analyst and cofounder at the smart investor said that the inability of evs to retain value had kept him from investing in the industry according to kuo evs are analogous to other consumer electronics like laptops and cell phones in that they tend to lose value and relevance quickly after being sold the same depreciation is going to happen to electric vehicles itll probably cost you   to buy one but in a years time it will depreciate much faster than an internal combustion engine car he said industry insiders have also flagged ev resale problems kuo further argued that the software and computing capabilities of used evs may become outdated and incompatible with updates by the time they are sold or even beforehand that will be a lightbulb moment when buyers realize they paid too much in the first place he added despite evs apparent depreciation issue its causes might have less to do with the technology itself and more to do with market conditions according to iseecars dramatic drops in used electric vehicle values in the us have largely been driven by aggressive price cuts by tesla is the dominant ev seller in the us and as a result of lower prices for its new evs buyers are less likely to entertain the same price levels for used alternatives if elon musk continues to reduce tesla prices in an effort to stimulate sales hell continue to pull the entire market down as he did over the past  months iseecars brauer said in an october earnings call musk defended the price cuts emphasizing the importance of cost to consumers its not an optional thing for most people it is a necessary thing we have to make our cars more affordable so people can buy them he said in the following quarters earnings call in january chief financial officer vaibhav taneja said the company would continue to focus on its cost reduction efforts in  since then the ev price war between tesla and chinese competitors has additionally overproduction of evs relative to demand has created excessive supply making it unlikely for new and used ev prices to rebound in the near term according to brauer what is an ongoing issue for the ev market however may be a boon for electric and combustion powered hybrids which are showing increasing strength in new and used vehicle markets the average price for used hybrid vehicles fell only  or  last year  a fraction of the decline of the average ev hybrids are an excellent stepping stone between gasoline and electric cars and i expect to see them increasing in popularity over the next  years brauer said ,,2024-04-07,,"Poor resale values of EVs threaten adoption, warn some experts "
