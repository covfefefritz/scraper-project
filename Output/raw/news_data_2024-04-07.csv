"<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is severing diplomatic relations with Ecuador following a police raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito, Ecuador's capital, where they arrested former Vice President Jorge Glas, who had sought political asylum in the embassy after being indicted on corruption charges. </p>

<p>AMLO announced Friday night that Ecuadorian police raided the Mexican embassy to arrest Glas. He has been hiding in the embassy since December as diplomatic relations between the two countries deteriorated. </p>

<p>On social media platform X, Alicia Bárcena, Mexico's foreign relations secretary, said her team will take Glas' detainment to the International Court of Justice ""to denounce Ecuador's responsibility for violations of international law.""</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <strong>paused the implementation of its climate disclosure requirements for companies as legal challenges against the rules are pending in a circuit court.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T105029.620.jpg?itok=Ce-fSoh_"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T105029.620.jpg?itok=Ce-fSoh_""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""8fa9167e-c8a8-4d12-bc02-442b4e9e08fb"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""300"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T105029.620.jpg?itok=Ce-fSoh_"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""9b8c052b-1990-4e71-80c3-2dcafb648be1"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""231"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shares of MP Materials have roundtripped Covid lows. </p>

<p>He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year."" </p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""7408c3fa-272d-405b-9e82-81ebd2e373be"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""325"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Omaha-Beach-FEATURED.jpg?itok=Z4DeCZ5o"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Omaha-Beach-FEATURED.jpg?itok=Z4DeCZ5o""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""508ec26f-136d-403c-8f71-ed05793b5edd"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""229"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Omaha-Beach-FEATURED.jpg?itok=Z4DeCZ5o"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Not a prosperous path to full employment: Soldiers under withering fire on D-Day’s Omaha Beach</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>
	</li>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/johnkonrad/status/1776625227100721497"">Captain John Konrad, CEO of gCaptain</a>, a website specializing in tracking the shipping industry, blames the ""West Point Mafia"" and decades of land wars in the Middle East for a hollowed-out US Navy that was entirely ""unprepared"" for the salvage operation of the collapsed 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. </p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p><em><strong>""And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength,"" </strong></em>he said, adding that China would've had the Baltimore shipping channel ""fully cleared in weeks,"" not months (<a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/baltimore-bridge-collapse-us-army-corps-engineers-says-channel-fully-reopen-end-may?ref=biztoc.com"">read more about the reopening timeline here</a>). </p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel. The issue is entering the heart of the Democratic establishment, threatening unity.</p>

<p>Axios <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel"">reports</a> that she ""<strong>signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israel</strong> over a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""</p>

Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), included the signatures of some 40 Democrats.</p>

<p>""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, <strong>we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers</strong>,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) announced on April 3 its backing of Westchester County Executive George Latimer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.</em></p>

<p><em>DMFI did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcing <a href=""https://x.com/DemMaj4Israel/status/1775561625413579064?s=20"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a slate</a> of endorsements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side</strong>. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the <em>anti-Israel </em>side. </p>

<p>Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition. <strong>Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gathering</strong> which marks the end of the Muslim <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/white-house-scales-back-iftar-gaza-horrors-declined-invites"">season of fasting</a>:  </p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""982962b8-f01f-4029-9baa-c43aba0a0a5a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""333"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p><strong>A massive army has been assembled to ensure that rival claims will not see the light of day for long. But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>It might sound quaint and out of touch with what some have now accepted as “the new normal”, but I say we should all wrap ourselves in the American Flag and send out the clarion call for a rush of strong, capable men to come to the aid of their country, in a manner as never before. </em></strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""dd5460a7-03ef-4383-a168-31130ecfa761"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""281"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcsstus1&amp;f=a"">https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcsstus1&amp;f=a</a></em></p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">
<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">The mainstream media has finally noticed <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/gold?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#gold</a>, but has no idea why it's rising, or has any appreciation for how high it's going. They're also not encouraging anyone to buy it. All of this is a good sign that the rally still has a long way to go before any meaningful correction.</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>The more skeptical analyses acknowledge that it will be <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-bulls-eye-more-record-highs-despite-lightning-gains-2024-04-05/"">an uphill battle</a> for it to sustain the same awe-inspiring upward pace that it has had since the start of the year. But even they, like I, <strong>still expect a confluence of factors in 2024 to continue pushing it higher.</strong></p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""9b8c052b-1990-4e71-80c3-2dcafb648be1"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""231"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shares of MP Materials have roundtripped Covid lows. </p>

<p>He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year."" </p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead.

<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel. The issue is entering the heart of the Democratic establishment, threatening unity.</p>

<p>Axios <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel"">reports</a> that she ""<strong>signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israel</strong> over a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""</p>

<p>""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, <strong>we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers</strong>,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<p><strong><em>A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) announced on April 3 its backing of Westchester County Executive George Latimer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.</em></p>

<p><em>DMFI did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcing <a href=""https://x.com/DemMaj4Israel/status/1775561625413579064?s=20"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a slate</a> of endorsements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side</strong>. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the <em>anti-Israel </em>side. </p>

<p>Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition. <strong>Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gathering</strong> which marks the end of the Muslim <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/white-house-scales-back-iftar-gaza-horrors-declined-invites"">season of fasting</a>:  </p>

<p>In 2019, around 105,000 people were estimated to have died from diseases connected to drug use, which constitutes a four-percent share of the overall deaths connected to behavioral risks in the country.</p>

<p><strong>This is especially striking compared to the same metric globally, where the share of deaths barely reaches one percent. </strong></p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence. Across the world, the United Nations is monitor­ing how mis- and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It has become clear that business as usual is not an option.”</em></p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

</ul><p>Each of these organizations are fueled and funded by many of the entities responsible for advancing the climate agenda, especially as it relates to the UN SDGs. This globalized amalgamation of media watchdogs, fact checkers, and disinformation regulators is powered by billion-dollar corporations, democratic and undemocratic governments, influential foundations, and powerful NGOs. The list includes <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/21/fact-sheet-prioritizing-climate-in-foreign-policy-and-national-security/"">The White House</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/2820047/state-department-disinformation-tracker-gdi-redacts-tax-forms/"">U.S. State Department</a>, <a href=""https://foundationforfreedomonline.com/newsguard-strategy-revealed-financial-throttling-virality/"">U.S. Department of Defense</a>, <a href=""https://reason.com/2022/10/31/dhs-still-policing-disinformation-despite-dissolving-disinformation-governance-board/"">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/fbi-colluded-twitter-suppress-free-speech-where-outrage-opinion-1768801"">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</a>, <a href=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/NSF-Staff-Report_Appendix.pdf"">The National Science Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://shareverified.com/about/"">United Nations</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/major-funders/"">Poynter Institute</a>, <a href=""https://www.ned.org/"">National Endowment for Democracy</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2017/largest-funders-of-the-poynter-institute/"">Open Society Foundations</a>, <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/13-million-in-grants-from-omidyar-network-open-society-foundations-will-expand-poynters-international-fact-checking-network-300481553.html"">Omidyar Network</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-obsessed-ap-blames-humanity-for-hellish-summer-of-earths-discontent/"">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/billionaire-fueled-rockefeller-fund-coordinated-climate-lawsuits-with-dem-state-ag-docs-show/"">Rockefeller Family Fund</a>, <a href=""https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2015/11/opp1138320"">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/google-youtube-fact-checking-misinformation"">Google</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/formedia/mjp/programs/third-party-fact-checking/"">Meta</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/microsoft-expands-newsguard-adoption/"">Microsoft</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber?

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>We are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues.

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <strong>paused the implementation of its climate disclosure requirements for companies as legal challenges against the rules are pending in a circuit court.</strong></p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""dd5460a7-03ef-4383-a168-31130ecfa761"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""281"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

They're also not encouraging anyone to buy it. All of this is a good sign that the rally still has a long way to go before any meaningful correction.</p>

",,2024-04-07,,Too Hot To Handle: Gold Due For A Correction?
"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""9b8c052b-1990-4e71-80c3-2dcafb648be1"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""231"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shares of MP Materials have roundtripped Covid lows. </p>

<p>He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year."" </p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em><strong>American Rare Earths Ltd (ARR.AX | Market Cap ~A$138 million)</strong>: ARR is a rare earth exploration &amp; development company.

"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>
	</li>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/johnkonrad/status/1776625227100721497"">Captain John Konrad, CEO of gCaptain</a>, a website specializing in tracking the shipping industry, blames the ""West Point Mafia"" and decades of land wars in the Middle East for a hollowed-out US Navy that was entirely ""unprepared"" for the salvage operation of the collapsed 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. </p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p><em><strong>""And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength,"" </strong></em>he said, adding that China would've had the Baltimore shipping channel ""fully cleared in weeks,"" not months (<a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/baltimore-bridge-collapse-us-army-corps-engineers-says-channel-fully-reopen-end-may?ref=biztoc.com"">read more about the reopening timeline here</a>). </p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

<p>The post below describes my intellectual journey and was published in <em>ZeroHedge</em> on June 21, 2022, and is highly recommended if you haven’t read it already.</p>

<p><strong>The Biden administration is aware of my work and apparently will do anything to prevent the reported unemployment number from climbing to 4.5 percent before the election, which would trigger a collapse of confidence.</strong></p>

<p>The adaptation level is currently at 4.53 percent. Look at the graph below.</p>

<p>There is still a gap of 4.53 - 3.8 = 0.73 unemployment percentage points, <strong>too wide for people to feel that “things are getting worse than what we’re used to.”</strong></p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel. The issue is entering the heart of the Democratic establishment, threatening unity.</p>

<p>Axios <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel"">reports</a> that she ""<strong>signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israel</strong> over a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""</p>

Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), included the signatures of some 40 Democrats.</p>

<p>""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, <strong>we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers</strong>,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) announced on April 3 its backing of Westchester County Executive George Latimer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.</em></p>

<p><em>DMFI did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcing <a href=""https://x.com/DemMaj4Israel/status/1775561625413579064?s=20"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a slate</a> of endorsements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side</strong>. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the <em>anti-Israel </em>side. </p>

<p>Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition. <strong>Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gathering</strong> which marks the end of the Muslim <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/white-house-scales-back-iftar-gaza-horrors-declined-invites"">season of fasting</a>:  </p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

<p><strong>Coming in second on a global level as well as in terms of risk-factor-associated <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/1294/death/#topicOverview"">deaths in the United States</a> in 2019 is alcohol use with an estimated 2.4 million global and 137,000 U.S. deaths in 2019. </strong></p>

<p>In 2019, around 105,000 people were estimated to have died from diseases connected to drug use, which constitutes a four-percent share of the overall deaths connected to behavioral risks in the country.</p>

<p><strong>This is especially striking compared to the same metric globally, where the share of deaths barely reaches one percent. </strong></p>

<p>The total number of deaths from risk factors in the United States amounted to 1.8 million, while the global number stood at 35 million.</p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p><strong><em>The gauntlet has been cast by the media-censorship complex. Just prior to this year’s annual globalist confab in Davos, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced that misinformation and disinformation are currently <a href=""https://clintel.org/wef-say-worlds-greatest-threat-is-misinformation-the-biggest-threat-to-experts-and-billionaires-is-free-speech/"">the greatest threats to humanity</a>, with the release of its <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/"">Global Risks Report 2024</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence. Across the world, the United Nations is monitor­ing how mis- and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It has become clear that business as usual is not an option.”</em></p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>We are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues.

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""982962b8-f01f-4029-9baa-c43aba0a0a5a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""333"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

"<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is severing diplomatic relations with Ecuador following a police raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito, Ecuador's capital, where they arrested former Vice President Jorge Glas, who had sought political asylum in the embassy after being indicted on corruption charges. </p>

<p>AMLO announced Friday night that Ecuadorian police raided the Mexican embassy to arrest Glas. He has been hiding in the embassy since December as diplomatic relations between the two countries deteriorated. </p>

<p>On social media platform X, Alicia Bárcena, Mexico's foreign relations secretary, said her team will take Glas' detainment to the International Court of Justice ""to denounce Ecuador's responsibility for violations of international law.""</p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""dd5460a7-03ef-4383-a168-31130ecfa761"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""281"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcsstus1&amp;f=a"">https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcsstus1&amp;f=a</a></em></p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

</ul><p>In addition to profiting from what could soon be an explosion of investment in the mining sector, we outlined to readers days ago another big trade theme in a note titled <em><a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/next-ai-trade"">""The Next AI Trade.""</a></em></p>
",,2024-04-07,,Next Big Mineral Trade Revealed By Morgan Stanley 
"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""7408c3fa-272d-405b-9e82-81ebd2e373be"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""325"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

"<p><a href=""https://mises.org/mises-wire/more-easy-money-will-plunge-us-stagflation""><em>Authored by Daniel Lacalle via The Mises Institute,</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/johnkonrad/status/1776625227100721497"">Captain John Konrad, CEO of gCaptain</a>, a website specializing in tracking the shipping industry, blames the ""West Point Mafia"" and decades of land wars in the Middle East for a hollowed-out US Navy that was entirely ""unprepared"" for the salvage operation of the collapsed 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. </p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel. The issue is entering the heart of the Democratic establishment, threatening unity.</p>

<p>Axios <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel"">reports</a> that she ""<strong>signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israel</strong> over a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""</p>

Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), included the signatures of some 40 Democrats.</p>

<p>""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, <strong>we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers</strong>,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) announced on April 3 its backing of Westchester County Executive George Latimer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.</em></p>

<p><em>DMFI did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcing <a href=""https://x.com/DemMaj4Israel/status/1775561625413579064?s=20"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a slate</a> of endorsements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side</strong>. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the <em>anti-Israel </em>side. </p>

<p>Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition. <strong>Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gathering</strong> which marks the end of the Muslim <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/white-house-scales-back-iftar-gaza-horrors-declined-invites"">season of fasting</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>The event scheduled for Tuesday will be in <strong>stark contrast to previous Muslim celebrations</strong> and gatherings under the Biden administration, which have seen packed ballrooms of Muslims from all over the country joining the White House festivities. </em></p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

"<p><em><strong>""Smoking kills"" </strong></em>is but one of the slogans connected to anti-tobacco advocacy groups - and it's quite true.</p>

<p><strong>Coming in second on a global level as well as in terms of risk-factor-associated <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/1294/death/#topicOverview"">deaths in the United States</a> in 2019 is alcohol use with an estimated 2.4 million global and 137,000 U.S. deaths in 2019. </strong></p>

<p>Roughly 57 and 30 percent of global deaths associated with risk factors and connected to substance abuse and digestive diseases, respectively, can be traced back to alcohol use.</p>

<p><strong>While a high-sodium diet is connected to almost two million deaths on a global scale and therefore ranks third worldwide, the United States have a different problem: <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/3088/drug-use-in-the-us/#topicOverview"">drug abuse</a>.</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, around 105,000 people were estimated to have died from diseases connected to drug use, which constitutes a four-percent share of the overall deaths connected to behavioral risks in the country.</p>

<p><strong>This is especially striking compared to the same metric globally, where the share of deaths barely reaches one percent. </strong></p>

<p>The total number of deaths from risk factors in the United States amounted to 1.8 million, while the global number stood at 35 million.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.statista.com/insights/consumer"">Statista Consumer Insights macro-survey</a>, <strong>respondents in <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/6575/health-in-nigeria/#topicOverview"">Nigeria</a> were particularly likely to say that they are satisfied or very satisfied with their general state of health in the last twelve months </strong>(85 percent).</p>

<p>By contrast, <strong>respondents in South Korea responded more negatively, with only 36 percent</strong> answering that they are satisfied or very satisfied with their health.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting here that this data <strong>does not necessarily mean that the inhabitants of South Korea are in worse health than those of Nigeria,</strong> for example, but that perceptions of health may differ.</p>

<p>This survey does not offer a look at the level of health of the population, but a glimpse of how people in different countries perceive their general state of health.</p>

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>It might sound quaint and out of touch with what some have now accepted as “the new normal”, but I say we should all wrap ourselves in the American Flag and send out the clarion call for a rush of strong, capable men to come to the aid of their country, in a manner as never before. </em></strong></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights.

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p><strong>A massive army has been assembled to ensure that rival claims will not see the light of day for long. But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>We are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues. There is no good reason why continued debate featuring those on all sides of the issue should not be occurring, unless of course there are other reasons for ramming this fear-based agenda down our throats.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

"<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is severing diplomatic relations with Ecuador following a police raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito, Ecuador's capital, where they arrested former Vice President Jorge Glas, who had sought political asylum in the embassy after being indicted on corruption charges. </p>

<p>AMLO announced Friday night that Ecuadorian police raided the Mexican embassy to arrest Glas. He has been hiding in the embassy since December as diplomatic relations between the two countries deteriorated. </p>

<p>Canseco continued, ""I am very worried because they could kill him. There is no basis to do this. This is totally outside the norm.""</p>

<p>Glas, one of the most wanted men in the South American country, was recently convicted of bribery and corruption. </p>

<p>AMLO called Glas' arrest an ""authoritarian act"" and ""a flagrant violation of international law and the sovereignty of Mexico.""</p>

<p>Hours before the raid, Mexico granted Glas political asylum - something the Ecuadorian government viewed as illegal. </p>

<p>Ecuador's Presidency wrote in a statement, ""Ecuador is a sovereign nation, and we are not going to allow any criminal to stay free."" </p>

<p>On social media platform X, Alicia Bárcena, Mexico's foreign relations secretary, said her team will take Glas' detainment to the International Court of Justice ""to denounce Ecuador's responsibility for violations of international law.""</p>

"<p><a href=""https://mises.org/mises-wire/more-easy-money-will-plunge-us-stagflation""><em>Authored by Daniel Lacalle via The Mises Institute,</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">
<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">The mainstream media has finally noticed <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/gold?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#gold</a>, but has no idea why it's rising, or has any appreciation for how high it's going. They're also not encouraging anyone to buy it. All of this is a good sign that the rally still has a long way to go before any meaningful correction.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <strong>paused the implementation of its climate disclosure requirements for companies as legal challenges against the rules are pending in a circuit court.</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T105029.620.jpg?itok=Ce-fSoh_"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T105029.620.jpg?itok=Ce-fSoh_""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""8fa9167e-c8a8-4d12-bc02-442b4e9e08fb"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""300"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T105029.620.jpg?itok=Ce-fSoh_"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Canton%20Electric.jpeg?itok=WGQKPN7S"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Canton%20Electric.jpeg?itok=WGQKPN7S""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""fab7e7df-c3d1-4161-a3bd-b53113a0ab10"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""764"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Canton%20Electric.jpeg?itok=WGQKPN7S"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""9b8c052b-1990-4e71-80c3-2dcafb648be1"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""231"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shares of MP Materials have roundtripped Covid lows. </p>

<p>He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year."" </p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

<p>The post below describes my intellectual journey and was published in <em>ZeroHedge</em> on June 21, 2022, and is highly recommended if you haven’t read it already.</p>

<p>There is still a gap of 4.53 - 3.8 = 0.73 unemployment percentage points, <strong>too wide for people to feel that “things are getting worse than what we’re used to.”</strong></p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel.

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

Trump speaks at a rally in Laconia, N.H., on Jan. 22, 2024. (Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times)</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/johnkonrad/status/1776625227100721497"">Captain John Konrad, CEO of gCaptain</a>, a website specializing in tracking the shipping industry, blames the ""West Point Mafia"" and decades of land wars in the Middle East for a hollowed-out US Navy that was entirely ""unprepared"" for the salvage operation of the collapsed 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. </p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p><em><strong>""And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength,"" </strong></em>he said, adding that China would've had the Baltimore shipping channel ""fully cleared in weeks,"" not months (<a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/baltimore-bridge-collapse-us-army-corps-engineers-says-channel-fully-reopen-end-may?ref=biztoc.com"">read more about the reopening timeline here</a>). </p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p><strong><em>The gauntlet has been cast by the media-censorship complex. Just prior to this year’s annual globalist confab in Davos, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced that misinformation and disinformation are currently <a href=""https://clintel.org/wef-say-worlds-greatest-threat-is-misinformation-the-biggest-threat-to-experts-and-billionaires-is-free-speech/"">the greatest threats to humanity</a>, with the release of its <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/"">Global Risks Report 2024</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence. Across the world, the United Nations is monitor­ing how mis- and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It has become clear that business as usual is not an option.”</em></p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p><strong>A massive army has been assembled to ensure that rival claims will not see the light of day for long. But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>We are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues. There is no good reason why continued debate featuring those on all sides of the issue should not be occurring, unless of course there are other reasons for ramming this fear-based agenda down our throats.</strong></em></p>

<p><em>We’ll examine the other reasons in Part 2 of this series.</em></p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shares of MP Materials have roundtripped Covid lows. </p>

<p>He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year."" </p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em><strong>American Rare Earths Ltd (ARR.AX | Market Cap ~A$138 million)</strong>: ARR is a rare earth exploration &amp; development company. Their 100% owned flagship project, Halleck Creek deposit, is located in Wyoming and has extensive rare earth mineralization. According to the company, the project has the potential to be amongst the largest rare earth deposits in the US</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em><strong>USA Rare Earth (Private): </strong>According to USA Rare Earth, the company owns the only scalable, sintered neo-magnet manufacturing system in the Western Hemisphere (located in Oklahoma). The company is targeting magnet production in 2024 and is aiming to supply the plant with rare earth feed stock mined from the Round Top property in Texas in late 2025 or early 2026. USA Rare Earth owns an 80% stake in the Round Top property, Texas Mineral Resources (OTCBQ: TMRC) owns the remaining 20% stake.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

<p>The post below describes my intellectual journey and was published in <em>ZeroHedge</em> on June 21, 2022, and is highly recommended if you haven’t read it already.</p>

<p><strong>The Biden administration is aware of my work and apparently will do anything to prevent the reported unemployment number from climbing to 4.5 percent before the election, which would trigger a collapse of confidence.</strong></p>

<p>The adaptation level is currently at 4.53 percent. Look at the graph below.</p>

<p>There is still a gap of 4.53 - 3.8 = 0.73 unemployment percentage points, <strong>too wide for people to feel that “things are getting worse than what we’re used to.”</strong></p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Canton%20Electric.jpeg?itok=WGQKPN7S"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Canton%20Electric.jpeg?itok=WGQKPN7S""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""fab7e7df-c3d1-4161-a3bd-b53113a0ab10"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""764"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Canton%20Electric.jpeg?itok=WGQKPN7S"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/johnkonrad/status/1776625227100721497"">Captain John Konrad, CEO of gCaptain</a>, a website specializing in tracking the shipping industry, blames the ""West Point Mafia"" and decades of land wars in the Middle East for a hollowed-out US Navy that was entirely ""unprepared"" for the salvage operation of the collapsed 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. </p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p><em><strong>""And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength,"" </strong></em>he said, adding that China would've had the Baltimore shipping channel ""fully cleared in weeks,"" not months (<a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/baltimore-bridge-collapse-us-army-corps-engineers-says-channel-fully-reopen-end-may?ref=biztoc.com"">read more about the reopening timeline here</a>). </p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel.

Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), included the signatures of some 40 Democrats.</p>

<p>""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, <strong>we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers</strong>,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<p><strong><em>A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side</strong>. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the <em>anti-Israel </em>side. </p>

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""982962b8-f01f-4029-9baa-c43aba0a0a5a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""333"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

Trump speaks at a rally in Laconia, N.H., on Jan. 22, 2024. (Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times)</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

"<p><em><strong>""Smoking kills"" </strong></em>is but one of the slogans connected to anti-tobacco advocacy groups - and it's quite true.</p>

<p><strong>Coming in second on a global level as well as in terms of risk-factor-associated <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/1294/death/#topicOverview"">deaths in the United States</a> in 2019 is alcohol use with an estimated 2.4 million global and 137,000 U.S. deaths in 2019. </strong></p>

<p>Roughly 57 and 30 percent of global deaths associated with risk factors and connected to substance abuse and digestive diseases, respectively, can be traced back to alcohol use.</p>

<p>In 2019, around 105,000 people were estimated to have died from diseases connected to drug use, which constitutes a four-percent share of the overall deaths connected to behavioral risks in the country.</p>

<p><strong>This is especially striking compared to the same metric globally, where the share of deaths barely reaches one percent. </strong></p>

<p>The total number of deaths from risk factors in the United States amounted to 1.8 million, while the global number stood at 35 million.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting here that this data <strong>does not necessarily mean that the inhabitants of South Korea are in worse health than those of Nigeria,</strong> for example, but that perceptions of health may differ.</p>

<p>This survey does not offer a look at the level of health of the population, but a glimpse of how people in different countries perceive their general state of health.</p>

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary. But I’ve tried to give the Reader as comprehensive an assessment as I possibly can with this piece.</em></p>

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>It might sound quaint and out of touch with what some have now accepted as “the new normal”, but I say we should all wrap ourselves in the American Flag and send out the clarion call for a rush of strong, capable men to come to the aid of their country, in a manner as never before. </em></strong></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence.

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

</ul><p>Each of these organizations are fueled and funded by many of the entities responsible for advancing the climate agenda, especially as it relates to the UN SDGs. This globalized amalgamation of media watchdogs, fact checkers, and disinformation regulators is powered by billion-dollar corporations, democratic and undemocratic governments, influential foundations, and powerful NGOs.

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p><strong>A massive army has been assembled to ensure that rival claims will not see the light of day for long. But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>We are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues. There is no good reason why continued debate featuring those on all sides of the issue should not be occurring, unless of course there are other reasons for ramming this fear-based agenda down our throats.</strong></em></p>

<p><em>We’ll examine the other reasons in Part 2 of this series.</em></p>

<p>""The current move can largely be attributed to a heat wave in Vietnam affecting Robusta coffee production and as a result, providing carryover support for premium Arabica beans,"" Aakash Doshi, senior commodities strategist at Citi, wrote in a note to clients. </p>

<p>Doshi forecasts Arabica coffee futures to be trading between $1.88 and $2.15 through the 2024 calendar year. He indicated prices could go higher if the physical outlook tightens. </p>

<p>Separately, Hernando De La Roche, a senior vice president at StoneX Financial Inc., told Bloomberg that dealers were caught in a vicious ""short and forced to cover while funds have been adding long positions,"" adding that importers were forced to abandon hedges. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the recent surge in Brent crude prices due to the worsening geopolitical situation in the Middle East could begin to lift global food prices. </p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <strong>paused the implementation of its climate disclosure requirements for companies as legal challenges against the rules are pending in a circuit court.</strong></p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides.

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>
	</li>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

<p>The post below describes my intellectual journey and was published in <em>ZeroHedge</em> on June 21, 2022, and is highly recommended if you haven’t read it already.</p>

<p><strong>The Biden administration is aware of my work and apparently will do anything to prevent the reported unemployment number from climbing to 4.5 percent before the election, which would trigger a collapse of confidence.</strong></p>

<p>The adaptation level is currently at 4.53 percent. Look at the graph below.</p>

<p>There is still a gap of 4.53 - 3.8 = 0.73 unemployment percentage points, <strong>too wide for people to feel that “things are getting worse than what we’re used to.”</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the BLS will simply stop reporting an unemployment number. This is what the Chinese did with their youth unemployment series.</p>

<p>Or perhaps they’ll issue a report with all the data redacted like the FDA did with their myocarditis analysis. Every page was redacted.</p>

"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/johnkonrad/status/1776625227100721497"">Captain John Konrad, CEO of gCaptain</a>, a website specializing in tracking the shipping industry, blames the ""West Point Mafia"" and decades of land wars in the Middle East for a hollowed-out US Navy that was entirely ""unprepared"" for the salvage operation of the collapsed 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. </p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p><em><strong>""And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength,"" </strong></em>he said, adding that China would've had the Baltimore shipping channel ""fully cleared in weeks,"" not months (<a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/baltimore-bridge-collapse-us-army-corps-engineers-says-channel-fully-reopen-end-may?ref=biztoc.com"">read more about the reopening timeline here</a>). </p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

"<p><em><strong>""Smoking kills"" </strong></em>is but one of the slogans connected to anti-tobacco advocacy groups - and it's quite true.</p>

<p>When looking at behavioral risks, meaning types of risk that can largely be avoided, especially in highly industrialized nations, <strong>smoking cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products is connected to a variety of diseases responsible for 7.7 million deaths worldwide</strong>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.statista.com/chart/32039/behavioral-risks-leading-to-highest-estimated-number-of-deaths-from-related-diseases/"">As Statista's Florian Zandt shows in the chart below</a>, based on <a href=""https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/"">data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> at the University of Washington shows,<strong> no other behavioral risk factor comes close to the disease burden of smoking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coming in second on a global level as well as in terms of risk-factor-associated <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/1294/death/#topicOverview"">deaths in the United States</a> in 2019 is alcohol use with an estimated 2.4 million global and 137,000 U.S. deaths in 2019. </strong></p>

<p>Roughly 57 and 30 percent of global deaths associated with risk factors and connected to substance abuse and digestive diseases, respectively, can be traced back to alcohol use.</p>

<p><strong>While a high-sodium diet is connected to almost two million deaths on a global scale and therefore ranks third worldwide, the United States have a different problem: <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/3088/drug-use-in-the-us/#topicOverview"">drug abuse</a>.</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, around 105,000 people were estimated to have died from diseases connected to drug use, which constitutes a four-percent share of the overall deaths connected to behavioral risks in the country.</p>

<p><strong>This is especially striking compared to the same metric globally, where the share of deaths barely reaches one percent. </strong></p>

<p>The total number of deaths from risk factors in the United States amounted to 1.8 million, while the global number stood at 35 million.</p>

<p><strong>While the consumption of most drugs is illegal and often carries a social stigma, <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/2301/alcohol-and-health/#topicOverview"">alcohol</a> and tobacco are legal drugs permeating all levels of society. </strong>The risks of both are well-known and well-documented, with the <a href=""https://monographs.iarc.who.int/agents-classified-by-the-iarc/"">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> classifying both as a group 1 carcinogen, which includes agents with ""sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans [and] both strong evidence in exposed humans that the agent exhibits key characteristics of carcinogens and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.""</p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel. The issue is entering the heart of the Democratic establishment, threatening unity.</p>

<p>Axios <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel"">reports</a> that she ""<strong>signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israel</strong> over a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""</p>

Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), included the signatures of some 40 Democrats.</p>

<p>""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, <strong>we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers</strong>,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) announced on April 3 its backing of Westchester County Executive George Latimer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.</em></p>

<p><em>DMFI did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcing <a href=""https://x.com/DemMaj4Israel/status/1775561625413579064?s=20"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a slate</a> of endorsements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side</strong>. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the <em>anti-Israel </em>side. </p>

<p>Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition. <strong>Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gathering</strong> which marks the end of the Muslim <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/white-house-scales-back-iftar-gaza-horrors-declined-invites"">season of fasting</a>:  </p>

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

<p><strong><em>The gauntlet has been cast by the media-censorship complex. Just prior to this year’s annual globalist confab in Davos, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced that misinformation and disinformation are currently <a href=""https://clintel.org/wef-say-worlds-greatest-threat-is-misinformation-the-biggest-threat-to-experts-and-billionaires-is-free-speech/"">the greatest threats to humanity</a>, with the release of its <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/"">Global Risks Report 2024</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence. Across the world, the United Nations is monitor­ing how mis- and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It has become clear that business as usual is not an option.”</em></p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

</ul><p>Each of these organizations are fueled and funded by many of the entities responsible for advancing the climate agenda, especially as it relates to the UN SDGs. This globalized amalgamation of media watchdogs, fact checkers, and disinformation regulators is powered by billion-dollar corporations, democratic and undemocratic governments, influential foundations, and powerful NGOs. The list includes <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/21/fact-sheet-prioritizing-climate-in-foreign-policy-and-national-security/"">The White House</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/2820047/state-department-disinformation-tracker-gdi-redacts-tax-forms/"">U.S. State Department</a>, <a href=""https://foundationforfreedomonline.com/newsguard-strategy-revealed-financial-throttling-virality/"">U.S. Department of Defense</a>, <a href=""https://reason.com/2022/10/31/dhs-still-policing-disinformation-despite-dissolving-disinformation-governance-board/"">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/fbi-colluded-twitter-suppress-free-speech-where-outrage-opinion-1768801"">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</a>, <a href=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/NSF-Staff-Report_Appendix.pdf"">The National Science Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://shareverified.com/about/"">United Nations</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/major-funders/"">Poynter Institute</a>, <a href=""https://www.ned.org/"">National Endowment for Democracy</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2017/largest-funders-of-the-poynter-institute/"">Open Society Foundations</a>, <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/13-million-in-grants-from-omidyar-network-open-society-foundations-will-expand-poynters-international-fact-checking-network-300481553.html"">Omidyar Network</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-obsessed-ap-blames-humanity-for-hellish-summer-of-earths-discontent/"">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/billionaire-fueled-rockefeller-fund-coordinated-climate-lawsuits-with-dem-state-ag-docs-show/"">Rockefeller Family Fund</a>, <a href=""https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2015/11/opp1138320"">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/google-youtube-fact-checking-misinformation"">Google</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/formedia/mjp/programs/third-party-fact-checking/"">Meta</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/microsoft-expands-newsguard-adoption/"">Microsoft</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming.

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

"<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is severing diplomatic relations with Ecuador following a police raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito, Ecuador's capital, where they arrested former Vice President Jorge Glas, who had sought political asylum in the embassy after being indicted on corruption charges. </p>

<p>AMLO announced Friday night that Ecuadorian police raided the Mexican embassy to arrest Glas. He has been hiding in the embassy since December as diplomatic relations between the two countries deteriorated. </p>

<p>Canseco continued, ""I am very worried because they could kill him. There is no basis to do this. This is totally outside the norm.""</p>

<p>Glas, one of the most wanted men in the South American country, was recently convicted of bribery and corruption. </p>

<p>AMLO called Glas' arrest an ""authoritarian act"" and ""a flagrant violation of international law and the sovereignty of Mexico.""</p>

<p>Hours before the raid, Mexico granted Glas political asylum - something the Ecuadorian government viewed as illegal. </p>

<p>Ecuador's Presidency wrote in a statement, ""Ecuador is a sovereign nation, and we are not going to allow any criminal to stay free."" </p>

<p>On social media platform X, Alicia Bárcena, Mexico's foreign relations secretary, said her team will take Glas' detainment to the International Court of Justice ""to denounce Ecuador's responsibility for violations of international law.""</p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

<p>The post below describes my intellectual journey and was published in <em>ZeroHedge</em> on June 21, 2022, and is highly recommended if you haven’t read it already.</p>

<p><strong>The Biden administration is aware of my work and apparently will do anything to prevent the reported unemployment number from climbing to 4.5 percent before the election, which would trigger a collapse of confidence.</strong></p>

<p>The adaptation level is currently at 4.53 percent. Look at the graph below.</p>

<p>There is still a gap of 4.53 - 3.8 = 0.73 unemployment percentage points, <strong>too wide for people to feel that “things are getting worse than what we’re used to.”</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the BLS will simply stop reporting an unemployment number. This is what the Chinese did with their youth unemployment series.</p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""9b8c052b-1990-4e71-80c3-2dcafb648be1"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""231"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>

<p>He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year."" </p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

",,2024-04-07,,Next Big Mineral Trade Revealed By Morgan Stanley 
"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""7408c3fa-272d-405b-9e82-81ebd2e373be"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""325"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>

Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

"<p><a href=""https://mises.org/mises-wire/more-easy-money-will-plunge-us-stagflation""><em>Authored by Daniel Lacalle via The Mises Institute,</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">

They're also not encouraging anyone to buy it. All of this is a good sign that the rally still has a long way to go before any meaningful correction.</p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel.

<p>Axios <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel"">reports</a> that she ""<strong>signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israel</strong> over a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<p>Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition. <strong>Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gathering</strong> which marks the end of the Muslim <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/white-house-scales-back-iftar-gaza-horrors-declined-invites"">season of fasting</a>:  </p>

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""982962b8-f01f-4029-9baa-c43aba0a0a5a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""333"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

"<p><em><strong>""Smoking kills"" </strong></em>is but one of the slogans connected to anti-tobacco advocacy groups - and it's quite true.</p>

<p>When looking at behavioral risks, meaning types of risk that can largely be avoided, especially in highly industrialized nations, <strong>smoking cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products is connected to a variety of diseases responsible for 7.7 million deaths worldwide</strong>.</p>

<p>Roughly 57 and 30 percent of global deaths associated with risk factors and connected to substance abuse and digestive diseases, respectively, can be traced back to alcohol use.</p>

<p><strong>While a high-sodium diet is connected to almost two million deaths on a global scale and therefore ranks third worldwide, the United States have a different problem: <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/3088/drug-use-in-the-us/#topicOverview"">drug abuse</a>.</strong></p>

<p>In 2019, around 105,000 people were estimated to have died from diseases connected to drug use, which constitutes a four-percent share of the overall deaths connected to behavioral risks in the country.</p>

<p><strong>This is especially striking compared to the same metric globally, where the share of deaths barely reaches one percent. </strong></p>

<p>The total number of deaths from risk factors in the United States amounted to 1.8 million, while the global number stood at 35 million.</p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead.

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence. Across the world, the United Nations is monitor­ing how mis- and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It has become clear that business as usual is not an option.”</em></p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

</ul><p>Each of these organizations are fueled and funded by many of the entities responsible for advancing the climate agenda, especially as it relates to the UN SDGs. This globalized amalgamation of media watchdogs, fact checkers, and disinformation regulators is powered by billion-dollar corporations, democratic and undemocratic governments, influential foundations, and powerful NGOs. The list includes <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/21/fact-sheet-prioritizing-climate-in-foreign-policy-and-national-security/"">The White House</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/2820047/state-department-disinformation-tracker-gdi-redacts-tax-forms/"">U.S. State Department</a>, <a href=""https://foundationforfreedomonline.com/newsguard-strategy-revealed-financial-throttling-virality/"">U.S. Department of Defense</a>, <a href=""https://reason.com/2022/10/31/dhs-still-policing-disinformation-despite-dissolving-disinformation-governance-board/"">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/fbi-colluded-twitter-suppress-free-speech-where-outrage-opinion-1768801"">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</a>, <a href=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/NSF-Staff-Report_Appendix.pdf"">The National Science Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://shareverified.com/about/"">United Nations</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/major-funders/"">Poynter Institute</a>, <a href=""https://www.ned.org/"">National Endowment for Democracy</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2017/largest-funders-of-the-poynter-institute/"">Open Society Foundations</a>, <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/13-million-in-grants-from-omidyar-network-open-society-foundations-will-expand-poynters-international-fact-checking-network-300481553.html"">Omidyar Network</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-obsessed-ap-blames-humanity-for-hellish-summer-of-earths-discontent/"">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/billionaire-fueled-rockefeller-fund-coordinated-climate-lawsuits-with-dem-state-ag-docs-show/"">Rockefeller Family Fund</a>, <a href=""https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2015/11/opp1138320"">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/google-youtube-fact-checking-misinformation"">Google</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/formedia/mjp/programs/third-party-fact-checking/"">Meta</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/microsoft-expands-newsguard-adoption/"">Microsoft</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber?

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>We are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues. There is no good reason why continued debate featuring those on all sides of the issue should not be occurring, unless of course there are other reasons for ramming this fear-based agenda down our throats.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

"Layoff announcements in February hit their highest level for the month since the global financial crisis, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The total of From a historical perspective, this was the worst February since 2009, which saw 186,350 announcements as the worst of the financial crisis was seemingly coming to an end. Financial markets bottomed the following month, paving the way for the longest economic expansion on record, lasting until the Covid pandemic in March 2020. For the year, companies have listed 166,945 cuts, a decrease of 7.6% from a year ago. ""As we navigate the start of 2024, we're witnessing a persistent wave of layoffs,"" said Andrew Challenger, the firm's labor and workplace expert. ""Businesses are aggressively slashing costs and embracing technological innovations, actions that are significantly reshaping staffing needs."" With a series of high-profile layoff waves, tech leads the way this year in cuts with 28,218, though that number has fallen 55% from the same period a year ago. Layoff announcements at financial firms have risen 56% compared with the first two months of 2023. Other industries planning significant cuts include industrial goods manufacturing (up 1,754% from a year ago), energy (up 1,059%) and education (up 944%). The layoff numbers, however, are not feeding through to Challenger's experts say companies most often cite restructuring plans as the main reason for the reductions in workforce. Artificial intelligence has been cited for just 383 cuts, though ""technological updates"" in general have been at the root of more than 15,000 reductions, or nearly as much as all the years combined since 2007. ""In truth, companies are also implementing robotics and automation in addition to AI. It's worth noting that last year alone, AI was directly cited in 4,247 job reductions, suggesting a growing impact on companies' workforces,"" Challenger reported. ",,,,"Layoffs rise to the highest for any February since 2009, Challenger says"
,,,,Fed caution may be justified if the labor market starts to deteriorate. Here's why that could happen
"The European Central Bank on Thursday lowered its annual inflation forecast, as its confirmed a widely expected hold of interest rates. ECB President Christine Lagarde, meanwhile, suggested market pricing for a June rate cut was coming into line with policymakers' outlook. Staff projections for inflation in 2024 were updated to an average 2.3% from 2.7%. Looking ahead, staff see inflation hitting the ECB's 2% target in 2025 and cooling further to 1.9% in 2026. They meanwhile updated their forecast for economic growth for 2024 to 0.6% from 0.8%, as the euro zone's economic activity escapes its ""We are in the disinflationary process and we are making progress,"" Lagarde said during a press conference on Thursday. ""We are more confident as a result, but we are not sufficiently confident, and we need more evidence, more data, and we know this data will come in the next few months. We will know a little more in April and a lot more in June."" Policymakers have repeatedly signaled May as a key date, since wage settlements are set to be released that month. The ECB will be ""laser-focused"" on two areas of inflation that could surprise, namely wage growth and profit margins, Lagarde said. There could also be a downside surprise to the outlook if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected or the global economic environment worsens unexpectedly, she added. The announcement increased market bets on rate cuts taking place in the summer of this year.

Policymakers were earlier this year spurred to firmly Lagarde also said Thursday that the ECB would not need to wait for headline inflation to hit its 2% target before taking a decision. Euro zone inflation Antonio Serpico, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, said that the most likely scenario involved rate cuts beginning in June of 25 basis points per meeting, for a total of 150 basis points or more in total. ""The numbers were quite reassuring actually, we were not expecting any cut today,"" he told CNBC's Silvia Amaro. ""Today's decision looks to be relatively dovish,"" he said, given that both growth and inflation forecasts moved lower. ""That means that the ECB governing council is seeing growth as more sluggish and lower than what they saw it before... and also in terms of headline inflation and core inflation, the new projections are definitely weaker than the older ones."" The main variable will be the stickiness of core inflation, driven by a tight job market, he added. Core inflation projections were updated to 2.6% in 2024 from 2.7%, and to 2.1% in 2025 from 2.3%.

"Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco reported a 25% decline in profit to $121.3 billion in 2023, down from $161.1 billion in 2022, and boosted its mega dividend payout despite ""economic headwinds."" Aramco raised its base dividend for the fourth quarter by 4% to $20.3 billion dollars, and lifted its performance-linked dividend by 9% to $10.8 billion, resulting in a $31 billion dollar payday for the Saudi government and Aramco stakeholders. Despite the earnings decline, the result still represents Aramco's second-highest net income on record, ""The year-on-year decrease can be attributed to lower crude oil prices and volumes sold, as well as reduced refining and chemicals margins, partially offset by a decrease in production royalties during the year and lower income taxes and zakat,"" Aramco said in a statement. Aramco said total revenue also fell 17% to $440.88 billion, down from $535.19 billion last year. Free cash flow also fell to $101.2 billion in 2023, compared to $148.5 billion in 2022. ""It was a year that saw global oil demand reach record levels despite geopolitical volatility, economic headwinds, and inflationary pressures,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told the earnings call on Sunday. ""We expect the global oil market to remain healthy over the remainder of this year, and we expect it to be fairly robust with growth of about 1.5 million barrels,"" Nasser added. Saudi Arabia led OPEC+ countries last week in a decision to The earnings come after the Saudi government transferred an additional 8% of Aramco shares, worth $164 billion, to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Yasir Al-Rumayyan is both the chairman of Aramco's Board of Directors and the governor of the PIF. The share transfer to PIF is one of the largest transactions Aramco has undertaken since listing, and will allow the PIF to benefit from Aramco's mega dividend payout policy. Aramco paid $97.8 billion in dividends in 2023, up 30% from 2022. The full year performance-linked dividend for 2024 is expected to be $43.1 billion alone. The share transfer ""doesn't change anything,"" Aramco Chief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed told the earnings call. ""We're healthy and we have no need to issue new equity,"" he said in response to a question about speculation of a PIF already owned 4% of Aramco, and controls Sanabil, a financial investment firm, which owns 4% of Aramco as well. The PIF's 16% state in Aramco, worth an estimated $328 billion, will strengthen the fund's financial position and boost its ability to The new Aramco stake also pushes PIF closer to achieving its end-2025 target of $1 trillion in assets under management.

If the forecast is close to accurate, it would mark a considerable downshift from ""This is kind of a cautious labor market. Employers are hiring to keep pace with business activity,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""Many businesses still report higher than expected sales. But they're not aggressively hiring for growth and to expand. For that, many are still taking a wait-and-see approach.""

February, though, could see growth as high as 240,000, as companies look to fill an elevated level of open positions, Pollak said. ZipRecruiter's Under normal conditions, those would all be positive attributes. But there are other concerns now. A jobs market that remains red-hot could deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates this year as expected. Earlier this week, Atlanta Fed President ""Once rate cuts begin, that will give a boost to certain industries that they've been waiting for, especially when it comes to capital investments,"" Pollak said.

Markets expect the Fed to start cutting rates in June, though the outlook has become less certain in recent weeks as policymakers weigh the direction of inflation.

This was the The department's ""I haven't seen layoffs,"" said Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a staffing and recruiting firm. ""What I keep seeing is the small- and mid-market going after market share, and the hiring seems to come in that bracket.

The trend continued into February, as But other sectors are still showing demand. Job postings surged 102% for physicians and surgeons, 83% for therapists and 82% for civil engineering. In its most recent survey of economic conditions, the Fed found that the ultra-tight labor market has loosened somewhat, but there are still active pockets. ""Businesses generally found it easier to fill open positions and to find qualified applicants, although difficulties persisted attracting workers for highly skilled positions, including health-care professionals, engineers, and skilled trades specialists such as welders and mechanics,"" the Fed said in its The report precedes each Fed meeting by two weeks and helps inform policymakers on trends across the economy.

Friday's report is expected to show average hourly earnings up just 0.2% on the month, down from a 0.6% jump in January, though still increasing at a 4.4% pace. The big monthly move in January came largely from a decline in the average work week, which elevates the appearance of average hourly earnings. Even with the hotter than expected inflation numbers, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank is ""A lot of the hourly wage increases were driven by two things primarily: more liberal municipalities, and a scarcity of workers from Covid,"" Gimbel said.

At the three-year range, expectations rose 0.3 percentage point to 2.7%, while the five-year outlook jumped even more, up 0.4 percentage point to 2.9%. All three are well ahead of the Fed's 2% goal for 12-month inflation, indicating the central bank may need to keep policy tighter for longer. Economists and policymakers consider expectations as a key factor in viewing the path of inflation, so the ""Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Headline inflation as judged by personal consumption expenditures prices, the Fed's preferred gauge, rose 2.4% in January — or 2.8% at the core level when excluding food and energy. Those readings represented progress in the Fed's battle, though some economists have warned the ""last mile"" back to 2% would be the most difficult. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady when it meets next week, with market pricing pointing to a cut in June followed possibly by three more before the end of the year, according to CME Group gauging of futures markets.

The The percentage of unemployed Black women, however, fell to 4.4% from 4.8%. This comes as the labor force participation rate within the group — which measures how many workers are currently employed or searching for work — rises to 63.4% from 62.9%. Valerie Wilson, director at the Economic Policy Institute's Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy, said that the labor market is showing positive signs for Black women. She pointed to the decrease in the unemployment rate, while the employment/population ratio edged higher to 60.6% from 59.9%. ""That seems unambiguously that things are moving in a positive direction,"" she told CNBC. As for why the cohort was able to buck the trend, Wilson said it could be due to the specific industries that added jobs last month. ""We saw increases in health care and government services, which are sectors where we see a significant number of Black women being employed,"" she said. ""The fact that those were two sectors that added jobs and had the highest job growth in the last month is probably a factor in that increased participation rate and reduced unemployment rate."" For Hispanic women, unemployment rose to 5% from 4.3%. Overall, with the unemployment rate still sitting below 4%, this month's report paints the picture of a strong labor market, Wilson said. ""At this point, at that lower rate of unemployment, you're not going to get huge shifts as long as that growth is still positive on the net,"" she said.

"Proclaiming that ""I'm a big believer in tariffs,"" former President In a CNBC interview, Trump cited both economic and political benefits from targeting foreign goods entering the U.S. ""I fully believe in them economically when you're being taken advantage of by other countries,"" the presumptive Republican nominee said during a "" The comments come as Trump is running a close race in the polls with President During his administration, from 2017-21, In China's case, many of the tariffs have remained in place under the Biden administration. ""China was taking advantage of us on the steel. They were destroying our entire steel industry, which was never doing very well over the last 25 years anyway ... because it's been eaten alive by foreign competition,"" Trump said. ""I put a 50% tax on China's steel coming in. And every person in the steel industry, when they see me they started crying. They would hug me."" Trump called out the Chinese automobile industry specifically for future targeting. ""China is right now our boss. They are the boss of the United States, almost like we're a subsidiary of China,"" he said. China produced about 30 million vehicles in 2023 and saw about a 50% year-over-year increase in January, according to MarkLines. A group of Democratic senators from auto-producing states recently Trump said he would seek tariffs to try to get China to build more of its cars in the U.S. ""The whole topic of tariffs is so simple.

"Rising gasoline prices likely put a floor under Economists expect that prices across a broad spectrum of goods and services rose 0.4% on the month, just ahead of the January pace for 0.3%, according to the Dow Jones consensus. Excluding food and energy, the increase for core inflation is forecast at a 0.3% gain, also one-tenth of a percentage point above the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, headline inflation is expected to show a 3.1% gain and core inflation a 3.7% increase when the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its latest reading on the consumer price index Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The respective 12-month readings in January were 3.1% and 3.9%. Though it has fallen sharply since its peak in mid-2022, inflation's resilience almost certainly will assure no Fed rate cuts at its next meeting March 19-20, and possibly into the summer, according to current market pricing. Markets were rattled in January when the ""While we do not expect the trend in inflation to re-accelerate this year, less clear progress over the next few months is likely to keep the Fed searching for more confidence that inflation is on course to return to target on a sustained basis,"" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said in a recent client note. Energy prices had eased earlier in the winter, putting some downward pressure on headline readings. But Wells Fargo estimates that energy services rebounded 4% in February, leading to an increase at the pump, where a gallon of regular gas is up about 20 cents, or more than 6%, from a month ago, The bank also estimates that goods prices have held their ground despite an easing in supply chain pressures and pressure from higher interest rates. On the brighter side, the House said lower prices on travel, medical care and other services helped keep inflation in check. Still, Wells Fargo has raised its full-year inflation forecast. The bank's economists now expect core CPI to run at a 3.3% rate this year, up from the previous 2.8% estimate. Focusing on the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the preferred Fed gauge, Wells Fargo sees inflation at 2.5% for the year, versus a prior estimate of 2.2%. Wells Fargo isn't alone in expecting a higher pace of inflation.

"Consumer spending bounced back in February from a January dip, with a little help from leap day. But sales still registered good gains even after correcting for that extra spending day. The CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor, derived from actual credit card spending data from Affinity Solutions, rose 1.06% in February, when excluding autos and gas. It increased 0.95% when taking out restaurants as well, the Retail Monitor's core measure. Removing the effect of the leap day, sales rose 0.4%, or less than half of the unadjusted gain, but they were still up from the 0.2% decline in January. Taking out restaurants, the Retail Monitor adjusted for the leap day was up 0.3%, compared with a 0.04% gain in January.

Looking at individual sectors, not adjusted for the leap day: The sector data was also impacted by the leap day and the index overall could differ more sharply this month from the Census Bureau retail data than it normally does. Unlike survey-based numbers collected by the Census Bureau, the Retail Monitor uses actual, anonymized credit and debit card purchase data compiled by Affinity and is not revised monthly or annually. Economists are looking for a 0.8% gain in the Census retail report on Thursday, a complete reversal of the 0.8% decline in January.

"BEIJING — Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla's Model 3, as price wars heat up in China's fiercely competitive electric car market. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss. Tesla's Model 3 starts at Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3's 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday. Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said.

The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event. Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price. The SU7 supports Apple's Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August. Tesla's Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company's ""Full Self Driving"" for city streets has yet to be released in the country. Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the ""Max"" version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche's Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan. The SU7 is part of Xiaomi's recently launched ""Human x Car x Home"" strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system.

While the 12-month pace is off the inflation peak in mid-2022, it remains well above the Fed's 2% goal as the central bank approaches its two-day policy meeting in a week. A 2.3% increase in energy costs helped boost the headline inflation number. Food costs were flat on the month, while shelter rose another 0.4%. The BLS reported that the increases in energy and shelter amounted to more than 60% of the total gain. Gasoline jumped 3.8% on the month while owners' equivalent rent, a hypothetical gauge of what homeowners could get renting their properties, rose 0.4%.

The year-over-year increase for headline CPI was 0.1 percentage point higher than January, while core was one-tenth of a point lower. Wall Street While the 12-month pace is off the inflation peak in mid-2022, it remains well above the Fed's 2% goal as the central bank approaches its two-day policy meeting in a week. Fed officials in recent weeks both have signaled that rate cuts are likely at some point this year and expressed caution about letting up too soon in the battle against high prices. The statement after the January meeting indicated that policymakers need ""greater confidence"" that inflation is moving back to target. Chair Jerome Powell, in congressional testimony last week, echoed those concerns, though he did mention that the Fed is probably ""not far"" from the point where it can start easing up on monetary policy. Tuesday's report ""leaves Fed officials some way from attaining the 'greater confidence' needed to begin cutting interest rates,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. For financial markets, the shift in the Fed stance from its apparent policy pivot in late 2023 has meant a repricing on the pace of rate cuts. Where futures traders entered the year expecting cuts to start coming in March, with six or seven total on the year, they have pushed out the first reduction to June, with two or three to follow, assuming cuts in quarter percentage point increments. A bustling economy has helped the Fed focus on incoming data and allowed policymakers to avoid having to rush to lower rates. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5% annualized pace in 2023 and is on pace to increase at a 2.5% pace in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker. One key ingredient in that growth has been a resilient consumer boosted by a strong labor market. The economy Such strength can be a double-edged sword: While the growth in the face of aggressive rate hikes has bought the Fed time on policy, it also raises concerns that inflation could be more durable than expected. Housing costs in particular have caused concern. Shelter comprises about one-third of the CPI weighting and has been slow to decelerate, at least according to the BLS measure. Fed officials see rental prices coming down through the year, and other measures outside the CPI computation of owners-equivalent rent have shown easing price pressures.

Those range from ""the economy is plunging into a recession to Goldilocks, everything is fine, nothing to see here. It's certainly mixed,"" she added. Job creation skewed toward part-time positions. Full-time jobs decreased by 187,000 while part-time employment rose by 51,000, according to the household survey. An alternative jobless measure, sometimes called the ""real"" unemployment rate, that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons rose slightly to 7.3%.

North added that the report probably ""doesn't change the narrative"" for the Fed, though he thinks the first cut may not happen until July.

But on Thursday he told the Senate Banking Committee that the state of the economy ""We've got a data-dependent fed, which means we're all at the mercy of the data,"" Sonders said.

<p>Canseco continued, ""I am very worried because they could kill him. There is no basis to do this. This is totally outside the norm.""</p>

<p>Glas, one of the most wanted men in the South American country, was recently convicted of bribery and corruption. </p>

<p>AMLO called Glas' arrest an ""authoritarian act"" and ""a flagrant violation of international law and the sovereignty of Mexico.""</p>

<p>Hours before the raid, Mexico granted Glas political asylum - something the Ecuadorian government viewed as illegal. </p>

<p>Ecuador's Presidency wrote in a statement, ""Ecuador is a sovereign nation, and we are not going to allow any criminal to stay free."" </p>

<p>On social media platform X, Alicia Bárcena, Mexico's foreign relations secretary, said her team will take Glas' detainment to the International Court of Justice ""to denounce Ecuador's responsibility for violations of international law.""</p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>

",,2024-04-07,,Next Big Mineral Trade Revealed By Morgan Stanley 
"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""7408c3fa-272d-405b-9e82-81ebd2e373be"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""325"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/cropped%20ration.jpg?itok=jkbVM1GH"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Omaha-Beach-FEATURED.jpg?itok=Z4DeCZ5o"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/Omaha-Beach-FEATURED.jpg?itok=Z4DeCZ5o""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""508ec26f-136d-403c-8f71-ed05793b5edd"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""229"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Omaha-Beach-FEATURED.jpg?itok=Z4DeCZ5o"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Not a prosperous path to full employment: Soldiers under withering fire on D-Day’s Omaha Beach</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>
	</li>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>While the economy has been stagnating for most people recently, we have not experienced this signal event, the collapse of confidence that occurs when the recession begins.</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <strong>paused the implementation of its climate disclosure requirements for companies as legal challenges against the rules are pending in a circuit court.</strong></p>

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

"In this article Business: Stock Market Value Percentage Ownership: Average Cost: Activist Commentary: On March 30, Sachem Head and Twilio Twilio is comprised of two main business units: Communications, which accounts for approximately 90% of revenue, and Segment, which accounts for 10% of revenue. The company is considered to be the industry gold standard for communications infrastructure, providing messaging, voice and email solutions to their customers. Twilio went public in But the problem is not solely lack of growth – Twilio is still growing at 8.5% per year. A bigger problem is that despite the level of revenue, even at $4.2 billion, the company has never even come close to being profitable. That is OK for a hyper-growth company. But companies with normal growth must show profitability to attract investors. Part of this problem is the inordinate amount of stock-based compensation Twilio pays: $676 million in 2023 (leading to an operating loss of $877 million). This has partly been the cause of the company's share count doubling since 2017 from approximately 90 million shares to 180 million shares. But there are several signs that the company has been heading in the right direction even prior to Sachem Head's appointment to the board. Stock-based compensation has declined in 2023 by 15.4% from $1.2 billion in 2022. Twilio has substantially reduced its headcount, cutting employees by 18% in the past year from 8,156 in 2022 to 5,867 in 2023. Moreover, Twilio's co-founder and former CEO Jeff Lawson resigned in The primary value creator here will be margin improvement. The company's nearest publicly traded peer Sinch, a smaller and lower quality business built through M&A of even smaller Twilio competitors, has generated positive operating profits and net income for several years with negligible to no stock-based compensation. Twilio should be able to do even better. While the company has demonstrated good intent and is doing a lot of the right things already, there is still plenty of upside potential on further margin expansion and reduction in stock-based compensation. This is a situation where the activist and management are like-minded, which led to a quick and quiet settlement rather than a public proxy fight. On March 30, Sachem Head received a board seat for Andy J. Stafman, partner at Sachem Head, and agreed to withdraw its notice of shareholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election to the board at the 2024 annual meeting. It is always a great activism engagement when the activist goes on the board to help management execute on a plan they all agree on, as opposed to convincing management that the activist's plan is better. We believe Stafman will be a valuable asset to Twilio in overseeing its margin expansion and other plans, but we also expect that he will hold management accountable if they fail to do so. Additionally, we think there is a strong possibility that Twilio gets its top-line growth up as well. Market intelligence and data providers Gartner and IDC still project an industry growth rate in the mid- to high-teens. As the market leader, Twilio should be at the high end of the range. Finally, Sachem Head is not the only activist actively engaged with Twilio. Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments. Twilio is owned in the fund. ",,,,Sachem Head’s Andy Stafman joins Twilio’s board. Here’s how he may help grow margins

"<p><em><strong>""Smoking kills"" </strong></em>is but one of the slogans connected to anti-tobacco advocacy groups - and it's quite true.</p>

<p>When looking at behavioral risks, meaning types of risk that can largely be avoided, especially in highly industrialized nations, <strong>smoking cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products is connected to a variety of diseases responsible for 7.7 million deaths worldwide</strong>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.statista.com/chart/32039/behavioral-risks-leading-to-highest-estimated-number-of-deaths-from-related-diseases/"">As Statista's Florian Zandt shows in the chart below</a>, based on <a href=""https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/"">data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> at the University of Washington shows,<strong> no other behavioral risk factor comes close to the disease burden of smoking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coming in second on a global level as well as in terms of risk-factor-associated <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/1294/death/#topicOverview"">deaths in the United States</a> in 2019 is alcohol use with an estimated 2.4 million global and 137,000 U.S. deaths in 2019. </strong></p>

<p>Roughly 57 and 30 percent of global deaths associated with risk factors and connected to substance abuse and digestive diseases, respectively, can be traced back to alcohol use.</p>

<p>In 2019, around 105,000 people were estimated to have died from diseases connected to drug use, which constitutes a four-percent share of the overall deaths connected to behavioral risks in the country.</p>

<p><strong>This is especially striking compared to the same metric globally, where the share of deaths barely reaches one percent. </strong></p>

<p>The total number of deaths from risk factors in the United States amounted to 1.8 million, while the global number stood at 35 million.</p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

Such a person may be able to stomach substantial financial losses and may reasonably hold 5% to 7% of their portfolio in crypto, Johnson added. However, that allocation would most likely not be appropriate for a 70-year-old investor who can't afford to subject their nest egg to major losses, he said.

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>It might sound quaint and out of touch with what some have now accepted as “the new normal”, but I say we should all wrap ourselves in the American Flag and send out the clarion call for a rush of strong, capable men to come to the aid of their country, in a manner as never before. </em></strong></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>Keep ringing the bell … the Liberty Bell and the sound of Freedom from sea to shining sea.</p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence.

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

</ul><p>Each of these organizations are fueled and funded by many of the entities responsible for advancing the climate agenda, especially as it relates to the UN SDGs. This globalized amalgamation of media watchdogs, fact checkers, and disinformation regulators is powered by billion-dollar corporations, democratic and undemocratic governments, influential foundations, and powerful NGOs.

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Much of what qualifies as climate research is funded by institutions that have already bought into the doomsday mantra of impending man-made disaster. The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p><strong>A massive army has been assembled to ensure that rival claims will not see the light of day for long. But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

"Rent prices The monthly cost for a one-bedroom apartment across the U.S. bumped up to $1,487, a 0.3% increase from February. The price of a typical two-bedroom apartment also jumped 0.5% to $1,847, according to a While prices are up overall, some metro areas saw declines. For example, the rent price for a one-bedroom apartment in Baltimore, Maryland, is $1,390, down 0.7% from a year ago, per Zumper. Arizona is unique, with rent decreases in all the major metro areas assessed. On a statewide level, the median price for one-bedroom apartments declined to $1,311 in March, about a 4% decline from $1,365 a year ago, according to Zumper data. The broader rental market's slight increase in prices may be a reflection of old seasonal patterns, experts say. ""It's kind of expected,"" said Crystal Chen, a spokeswoman for Zumper. ""When we get to the warmer months, that's when demand picks up."" More from Personal Finance: ""During the colder months of the year … the rental market tends to be cool,"" said Jacob Channel, a senior economist at LendingTree. ""As we get closer and closer to summer, we start to see rent prices increase in more places."" Yet, some fundamental factors such as supply and demand may also be reflected, said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Some markets in the country are cooling more than others. Prices in the Sun Belt and the intermountain areas are coming down, and Arizona is a prime example, Chen said. Zumper defines the intermountain region as Arizona, Nevada and Colorado. ""All of the Arizona cities on our report either had flat or declining year-over-year rates,"" she said. The city of Glendale, for example, had the largest rent decline, with one-bedroom prices down over 10% from this time last year. Arizona has a lot of supply coming online, keeping rent prices down in the area, Wachter explained. ""In the data, there's some evidence of fundamentals at play, in addition to seasonality,"" she said. Phoenix is expected to add more than 33,000 new units available this year and many buildings in the state are offering concessions, such as waived deposits or application fees and up to two months of free rent, Zumper found. ""If you're in that market, it's a great time for renters to snag an amenity-rich apartment that would have been out of reach otherwise,"" Chen said. While more supply is expected to surge in the Sun Belt and the intermountain region, a lot of Midwestern and Northeast markets are undersupplied, making rent prices push upward. ""The supply coming online absolutely does vary by market,"" Wachter said. Rent prices for one-bedroom apartments are up 25% in New York City from a year ago, according to Zumper. Rent costs and high competition also plague areas such as Columbus, Ohio, and Norfolk, Virginia. Yet, while prices increased, they've significantly declined from a year ago and even more compared with the market volatility from 2021 and 2022, when pent-up demand kept prices high. ""Rent prices are going up and they are expensive, but it's not suddenly skyrocketing again,"" Channel said. ""We don't expect to see national rates spike at all like in 2021 and 2022,"" Chen said. ""The seasonality is coming back after two crazy years."" While many factors affect housing affordability in the U.S., the main one, in simplest terms, is poor supply, Channel said. ""The more rental units that are built, the lower prices are likely to go, and I think Arizona shows that really well,"" he said.

"The idea of raising the Social Security ""No one should have to work longer than they want to,"" Fink recently ""But I do think it's a bit crazy that our anchor idea for the right retirement age — 65 years old — originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire,"" wrote Fink, who is 71. Republicans have touted raising the retirement age. Former presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she would raise the Social Security retirement age for The reason for the suggestion largely comes down to demographics. In the 1950s, many people who worked and paid into Social Security never lived long enough to retire and start receiving benefits, Fink noted. Today, the chances are higher that certain retirees over 65 may still be collecting Social Security checks until age 90, he wrote. Meanwhile, the number of baby boomers who reach age 65 is surging to historic levels. More than 11,200 Americans are expected to turn 65 every day — for a total of More from Personal Finance: That's as Social Security is facing a looming shortfall. The trust fund used to pay retirement and survivors benefits is projected to ""Age 65 is the anchor that is a cultural age which we have hung our retirement hat to for decades,"" said Jason Fichtner, chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center and executive director of the Alliance for Lifetime Income's Retirement Income Institute. ""It is no longer, I think, relevant,"" he said. Today, a new Social Security full retirement age of 67 is still getting phased in, prompted by changes enacted by Congress in 1983. Full retirement age is the point at which retirees stand to receive 100% of the benefits they've earned. For many years, Social Security's full retirement age Social Security benefits are available starting from age 62, "" Retirees who wait to claim until age 70 stand to get the biggest benefit — with an increase of up to 8% for each year they wait past full retirement age. Yet fewer than 10% of claimants wait until that age, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research and author of the book ""Work, Retire, Repeat: The Uncertainty of Retirement in the New Economy."" As lawmakers face a deadline to make changes and address the program shortfall, they generally may choose from a limited menu of options — hiking taxes, cutting benefits or a combination of both. Raising the retirement age, which is often presented as another option, is really a benefit cut, said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ""When you change the retirement age, it's particularly painful to those who have to keep retiring at 62, people with health issues or people in professions where no jobs are available,"" Munnell said. Congress may eventually raise the full retirement age to 69, predicts Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, even though Democrats have promised not to make that change. ""When you look at countries around the world that have had underfunded pension systems, they raise the retirement age,"" Biggs said. ""It's just a very, very common fix."" For each year the Social Security full retirement age is increased, that would cut benefits by a little under 7%, Biggs said. Pushing the age to 69 would repair less than one-fifth of Social Security's shortfall, so other reforms would also be necessary, Biggs said. Moreover, a new higher retirement age would have to be phased in much faster than the 40-year window used for the last increase, he said. Researchers and policy experts who have spent years studying Social Security's shortfall have their own wish lists for the changes they would make. Fichtner, who supports raising the retirement age, said that change would need to be paired with a higher minimum benefit, so as not to punish workers who cannot work longer. ""Some people have the ability to work, some people want to work, but some people can't,"" Fichtner said. ""It's important that we maintain a healthy minimum benefit amount at age 62."" Increases to the retirement age could be set to automatically adjust to changes in longevity, much as the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustments are tied to inflation, he said. Other experts would opt for different changes in place of raising the retirement age. Biggs advocates for moving to Munnell argues the most effective benefit cut would be to reduce the replacement rates for higher-income workers. Ultimately, workers want to retire on their own terms — at the age they want and with enough money to live comfortably. To make that more possible, employers need to engage older workers so they feel comfortable staying in the workforce, said David Blanchett, managing director and head of retirement research at PGIM DC Solutions. ""There's still potentially some implicit bias towards older Americans leaving the workforce,"" Blanchett said. ""If we can have a president over the age of 75 or 80, I think as a society we should be able to find more ways to accommodate older workers.""

"The Social Security Administration has The change applies to Approximately Under the new rule, which goes into effect Sept. 30, food will no longer count toward calculations for eligibility for benefits, known as In-Kind Support and Maintenance, or ISM. Currently, support in the form of food, shelter or both may count as unearned income for SSI beneficiaries, and therefore reduce their payments or affect their eligibility for benefits. More from Personal Finance: The monthly maximum federal SSI amounts in 2024 are To qualify for SSI, beneficiaries must generally earn That generally includes either money or other assets that can be turned into cash, such as bank accounts, bonds, property and stocks. The new rule means SSI beneficiaries will no longer have to worry that the groceries or meals they receive from family or friends may reduce their monthly benefits, said Darcy Milburn, director of Social Security and health care policy at The Arc, a nonprofit organization serving people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The Social Security Administration, in turn, will no longer have to use its limited resources to document every time a beneficiary received free food and then cut their monthly benefit by as much as a third, she said. ""It represents a really meaningful step to address one of the most complex, burdensome and inhumane policies impacting people with disabilities that receive SSI,"" Milburn said. The change is the first of several updates the Social Security Administration said it plans to put in place for SSI beneficiaries and applicants. ""Simplifying our policies is a common-sense solution that reduces the burden on the public and agency staff and helps promote equity by removing barriers to accessing payments,"" Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in a statement. The new rule may help provide some relief to SSI beneficiaries as high inflation continues to prompt ""People on SSI are one of the most food insecure groups in the United States,"" said Thomas Foley, executive director at the National Disability Institute. The new rule may also result in fewer overpayments or underpayments of benefits, and therefore increase financial security for beneficiaries, he said. Congress may have the opportunity to enact bigger changes to SSI through a ""Disability affects everybody, so it's a bipartisan issue,"" Foley said. ""Restricting asset limits to the $2,000 level really impacts people's ability to save and build a better financial future,"" he said. In December, bank CEOs including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon ""We have employees who don't want us to increase their salary because if it goes over a certain amount, they can't get that benefit which they're entitled to,"" Dimon said in December.

"If you miss a doctor's appointment these days, you could get hit with a "" This happened to me recently for the first time, and the charge was a steep $150. When I complained to friends and family, I learned that my experience wasn't unusual — most had dealt with a similar fee. I talked to experts and consumer advocates about why such fees are becoming common, if the charges are fair to patients and how to best avoid them. ""I very strongly support such fees,"" said ""Patients who don't show up are taking up appointments which other patients could use,"" said Loewenstein, adding that ""without such a fee, patients have little if any disincentive for not bothering to cancel appointments well in advance."" More from Personal Finance: Certified financial planner and physician ""If a patient doesn't show up, that costs the practice money,"" said McClanahan, a member of Caitlin Donovan, But, she said, ""to solve this problem is not to charge patients more fees, which many can't afford."" She has heard of medical offices having success with call and text reminders to patients about their appointments. Patients should always be given the opportunity to bow out, she said. That doesn't always happen. Earlier this month, my sister, Janna, tried to call her doctor twice to cancel her appointment for the next day. ""I was in elevator music purgatory for over 20 minutes,"" she said. Both times, she didn't get through to anyone. Three weeks later, she got a bill for a $100 ""no-show"" fee. For my appointment, I did get a call the day before from the doctor's office. But when I told the woman I'd forgotten about the appointment and couldn't make it, she said I'd still be charged a cancellation fee. Adam Rust ""But if penalty fees become a profit center, it may incentivize trickery and deception,"" Rust said. In addition to sufficient reminders and opportunities to cancel appointments for patients, there can be other creative alternatives to ""no-show"" fees, Donovan said. She recently spoke to one medical group in Camden, New Jersey, that had a problem with patients standing them up. They started asking people why they hadn't come. Many said they just didn't have reliable transportation to get there. ""They implemented a ride share, which came at a cost to the office, but their attendance levels went right up and more than compensated for the cost of the rides,"" Donovan said. When you make a doctor's appointment, ask about the office's policy around late cancellations and missed appointments, Donovan said. If you're told you'll be charged for missing an appointment, ask if you can reschedule it instead. You can also try asking the office if they can waive the charge if you find it unfair or if you can't afford it, she said. They should work with you. ""Ultimately, these fees are discretionary and I would be reluctant to work with any office that inflexibly charged them,"" Donovan said. On a practical note, debt owed to a doctor's or dentist's office is considered medical debt, a spokesperson for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told CNBC. Such debts that are less than $500 are not reported to the credit bureaus, they added. As a result, it seems unlikely that a no-show fee would harm your credit. When my sister Janna got her no-show invoice, she simply called the number on the bill and explained that she'd tried without success to cancel her appointment. The customer service agent agreed to waive the fee immediately. ""I feel like they have a system where they send out the bill for a no-show and then if people make the effort of calling it to question it, they'll get rid of it,"" Janna said.

"Social Security beneficiaries who owe money to the Social Security Administration may see much lower default withholding rates from their monthly checks, thanks to As of March 25, the Social Security Administration Instead, the agency will collect either 10% of a beneficiary's total monthly benefit or $10 — whichever is greater. But there may be a short period where beneficiaries are still affected by the old policy, the agency announced Friday. If that happens, affected beneficiaries should call the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213 More from Personal Finance: The new rules apply to overpayments, which are triggered when the amount of benefits due is miscalculated and checks are sent for higher sums than what beneficiaries are owed. When that happens, the Social Security Administration is required by law to seek repayment of the excess money paid to beneficiaries. But it might not be clear that an overpayment has happened for years, sometimes resulting in overpayment notices for tens of thousands of dollars. In recent years, the problem with overpayments has become worse, said David Camp, CEO at the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives. ""There were always far too many overpayments,"" Camp said, as the agency has struggled over the years with limited or outdated resources. ""Although in the last few years, it's been a steady, though shockingly high, sum total of overpaid individuals."" Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, beneficiaries who face strict limits on their income and assets are particularly vulnerable to overpayment issues, Camp said. The Social Security Administration said it is working to curb the burden to affected beneficiaries. ""We are no longer going to have that clawback cruelty of intercepting 100% of a payment if people do not respond to our notice,"" Commissioner Martin O'Malley said during recent testimony before the Senate. While the new repayment threshold applies to new overpayments, beneficiaries who currently have an overpayment withholding rate greater than 10% can contact the Social Security Administration to have that lowered, the agency said. All affected beneficiaries should call the agency about the 10% repayment rate, Camp said, but they need to approach the process with patience. The Social Security Administration does not have enough staff to answer a high volume of calls, so beneficiaries should expect a hold time, Camp said, as well as processing time. The Social Security Administration is also implementing other new policies to address overpayments, including shifting the burden of proof away from Social Security claimants when determining who is at fault for the error. The maximum time for repayment plans is being extended to 60 months, up from 36 months. It will also be easier for beneficiaries to request a waiver so they don't have to pay back the sums. ""The great majority of claimants never request a waiver, although many of them could qualify,"" Camp said. That's particularly true for beneficiaries who are struggling to meet their basic needs or who are at risk of being evicted because they are repaying Social Security, he said. ""Claimants ought to know that they can also ask for not having to pay it back at all if it wasn't their fault and they can't afford to repay,"" Camp said. To request a waiver, a beneficiary must Since O'Malley was sworn in as commissioner in December, he has taken some ""very aggressive steps"" toward addressing the overpayment issues that vex beneficiaries, said Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. ""They're so reasonable, it makes you wonder why no one did it before,"" said Richtman, referring especially to the end of the policy of withholding all of a beneficiary's monthly payments until the entire overpaid sum is repaid.

"When it comes to One key theme, overspending, tends to crop up, whether it be on For one pair of clients, realizing how much they had spent in the past 18 months on jewelry — $1.4 million — was a shock, said Barry Glassman, a certified financial planner and founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services in Vienna, Virginia. The following year, after meeting with Glassman, they pared those outlays down to about $8,800, which went mostly to jewelry repairs. ""When people see where their money is going, their behavior changes,"" said Glassman, who is a member of The ultra-high-net worth clients' spending is out of reach for most consumers. But the temptation to overspend can affect everyone, no matter their income. ""At the extreme, this is why most lottery winners go bankrupt,"" Glassman said. ""They feel like they've made it, they feel wealthy,"" he said. ""But they don't realize the difference between wealth and income."" Not all discretionary spending is negative, particularly if it is intentional and aligns with your goals, notes Preston Cherry, a CFP, founder and president of ""There shouldn't be social shame in spending to fund your well-being, present or future,"" said Cherry, who is also a CNBC FA Council member. But Glassman, Cherry and other experts on the council say there are certain risks that can damage your bottom line and put your ability to achieve other goals at risk. When it comes to splurges on big-ticket items, Louis Barajas, a CFP, enrolled agent and CEO of ""This is a work on mindset over budget,"" said Barajas, a CNBC FA Council member. One big-ticket purchase, buying a home, can set people back if they take on too much house or too big of a mortgage, notes CNBC FA Council member Cathy Curtis, a CFP and the founder and CEO of One family Curtis worked with missed out on a few houses by bidding too low. To correct that, they took their realtor's advice to bid high on the next house they found. Curtis' spreadsheets and advice on how much they could afford ""went right out the window,"" she said. The family's house payment, combined with property taxes and insurance, put them at risk for a cash crunch. They reached a low point when the husband lost his job, which prompted the wife to spend down her inheritance. Taking such risks on real estate can be a gamble. While homebuyers may grow into their payments with salary increases, that doesn't always work out, Curtis said. The silver lining is that most real estate tends to appreciate over time, and therefore can be a good investment, she said. When shopping for a home, it is better to treat it as a business decision rather than a personal one, Curtis advised. ""Buying a house can be a very emotional experience,"" Curtis said. ""I advise clients to keep their emotions in check and know that there will always be another house that is a better fit."" Another big-ticket purchase, a college education, may also require keeping emotions in check, particularly if a child's dream school will break the bank. ""Your kids can always borrow money for their college degree, but you can't borrow for your retirement,"" said CNBC FA Council member Ted Jenkin, a CFP and the CEO and founder of Jenkin said he tells clients to prioritize their retirement savings first, and to cut college savings if they are behind on that goal. Smaller purchases can have a sneaky way of adding up over time. When Glassman has his clients do an analysis of their spending, many find they are shocked how their dining-out habits add up. The same may apply to other categories, such as gifts or travel, he said. ""From there, 99% of the time, behavior changes,"" Glassman said, prompted by the realization that small adjustments, such as eating in one time per month or per week, can make a big difference. Assessing just how much is reasonable to spend is a lifelong endeavor, and often a tricky one in retirement. Some retirees may spend too much when they first retire, and be tempted to provide other family members with financial support, notes CNBC FA Council member Ivory Johnson, a CFP and the founder of ""I have had to tell clients to put their family on a budget because I understand the impact it'll have on their retirement,"" Johnson said. Not everyone is susceptible to overspending. For those who are instead prone to saving, drawing from their nest egg can feel uncomfortable once they reach retirement. ""It is challenging to shift from the good saving and investing habits that lead to a secure retirement to spending down assets,"" said CNBC FA Council member For investors who can afford to spend more, that can be a missed opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labor, through gifts to family, travel or donations to causes important to them, she said. Working with a financial advisor can help individuals assess whether their spending is too much, too little or just right. You can also do a gut check on your own by gauging your mindfulness with your money, Cherry suggests.

They ""cringe"" at the word budgeting, said Winnie Sun, co-founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California. ""It's sort of like telling someone they need to diet and eat healthy,"" said Sun, a member of CNBC's About 68% of consumers say a budget would help them reach their personal and family goals, yet 40% say they have never had a budget, according to a Sun estimates more than 60% of her clients ""feel as if they're literally going to suffer"" if Sun mentions budgeting. Conversations around budgeting are generally distilled into two camps: spending on needs (i.e., essential items) and wants (nonessential items). This framework is meant to help weigh one's financial priorities, thereby keeping spending in check, But the exercise can turn budgeting into a feeling of deprivation — and people rebel as a result. The classic financial advice of slashing spending on wants such as entertainment, social connection, dating and education, for example, is at odds with ""the natural process of human motivation,"" Newcomb wrote. ""Yes, the numbers must work, but your life must work, too,"" she wrote. ""Otherwise, you'll internally resist your budget, and we all know how that can play out."" Financial experts recommend reframing the budgeting concept as a positive rather than a negative. For example, households can think of it as ""raising funds"" instead of cutting spending, Sun said. They can also establish financial goals. For example, what do they want to do with their extra funds? That may be paying down debt, saving for the long term or growing a pot of money for shorter-term goals such as a vacation, Sun said. ""We let the goals lead the act of budgeting,"" she said. ""For me, a budget is not about restricting myself,"" Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, a personal finance expert known as the Money Coach, Similarly, Newcomb recommends identifying new strategies that can meet one's needs and simultaneously save money. Newcomb gives the real-life example of a husband and wife who argued about how much money he spends on his boat each year. His needs are about self-actualization: He enjoys the wind in his hair and the sun on his face. She seeks safety and security, which are also important to her quality of life. Here, the husband found a new strategy: offering sailing lessons to teens at his yacht club, which helped offset the cost of his boat and allowed his wife to funnel that additional income into savings. There are other easy ways households can find extra money without sacrificing much, Sun said. For example, households with more than one streaming service can opt to use one service for six months then change to another for the next six months, decreasing their streaming budget by 50%, she said. Households with an ample emergency fund intact can consider shopping for auto and other insurance policies with a higher deductible than their current policy, likely lowering monthly premiums, Sun said. In the event of an insurance claim, the emergency fund can meet the deductible, she said. They can also commit to doing curbside pickup when shopping for groceries, for example. Shoppers make purchases more mindfully and avoid in-store impulse buying, Sun said. She finds clients generally save 20% to 25% or more on their groceries this way. Any additional cash flow can immediately be used to pay down debt, or go into long-term savings or toward a short-term goal, she said. Ultimately, if there is a money issue, she challenges clients to decrease their spending by 5% to 10% during the month. After each week of success, she encourages them to celebrate by making memories instead of debt: perhaps by doing something with friends, or hanging out at a park, beach or someone's backyard. ""You have to have a joy to replace that negative,"" she said. ",,,,People hate budgeting. Here’s why — and how to reframe it
"New cars today are loaded with high-tech features for car shoppers, But with those advancements come questions about ""As much advancement as we have when it comes to new features, many of them are data dependent,"" he said, whether it's through a Almost every new vehicle collects different types of details about you — and they will share and sell that data, according to a More from Personal Finance: Most of the reviewed brands, 84%, share personal data with service providers, data brokers and other parties not named, the report found. About 76%, or 19 of the consulted brands, said they sell customer data to third parties. Only two car brands currently allow users to delete their personal data, Mozilla found: Renault and Dacia. ""This is still kind of the 'Wild, Wild West' of data collection and aggregation,"" said Theresa Payton, the founder, president and chief executive officer of Fortalice Solutions, a cybersecurity advisory firm. ""There are several challenges that remain in place for consumers,"" she said, as drivers try to find the best car that fits within their budgets and their own privacy concerns. To be sure, data collected by cars nowadays may not be too different from that shared from the ""cellphones already in our pocket,"" said Tom McParland, a contributing writer for automotive website Jalopnik and operator of vehicle-buying service Automatch Consulting. Said Drury: ""Think about how you use your phone. There's a lot of stuff that people don't realize that they've already given up when it comes to data."" While it remains to be difficult to do your own research, there are three steps car shoppers can take as they assess potential new cars, experts say. Once you narrow your options down to a specific vehicle, the first thing you can do is talk to the dealership and see what insight they can give you on that brand's data collection practices, experts say. You can ask representatives at the dealership about a carmaker's privacy policies and if you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of data collection, data aggregation and data monetization — or the selling of your data to third-party vendors, said Payton. Additionally, ask if you can be anonymized and not have the data aggregated under your name and your vehicle's unique identifying number, she said. People at the dealership ""might even point you towards talking to the service manager, who often has to deal with any repairs and any follow up and technical components,"" said Drury. ""Your service provider or the service adviser is actually going to have a little more insight versus the salesperson,"" he said. It may also be worthwhile to ask your auto insurance provider about car data collection, said Drury. Auto insurers may be receiving data of this nature as automakers share or sell it. While people at the dealership will have some knowledge on a specific vehicle, the insurance provider might give a better holistic view of it because they're covering many different makes and models, he said. ""I'd ask the insurance company, 'Are you using this and do you have an option to opt in or opt out different devices to monitor,'"" said Drury. These days, many newer vehicles essentially have an onboard computer. If you don't want to be tracked or have vehicle data collected and shared, you might find instructions in your owner's manual on how to wipe out your personalized data and information from the onboard computer, said Payton. ""That can be a great way if you are already in a car and you love the car, but you don't like the data tracking,"" she said. While you may not know if the data was already collected and sent out to third parties, you could do this on a periodic basis, she said. Some separate online tools might also help: An online resource called Privacy4Cars can help users delete personal data stored by automakers, including text messages and geolocations, Payton said. ""They are providing this tool to help users understand the data their cars collect and to give them an option to safeguard their privacy,"" she said. In a recent episode from The New York Times' ""The Daily"" podcast, a woman paid a mechanic $400 to remove the device in her vehicle that provided internet connectivity. She essentially While it may be possible to isolate and remove a car part or chip like this, you can't just rip out a CPU of a car, said McParland. ""Almost everything nowadays is going to have these integrated systems,"" he said. Drury agreed: ""These systems are so integrated with everything that your vehicle's doing. [The] sensors ... that help with [a] vehicle's semi-autonomous features, those are wired to your throttle, to your steering, to your breaks. It can be extremely dangerous for somebody to go around there and start unplugging things."" Drivers can always tap into the older, used car market to find a vehicle without high-tech features, but such cars might have their own risks the older they are, said McParland. Additionally, the car's onboard computer can provide a lot of safety features like car alerts, said Payton: ""If you were to ostensibly turn off the onboard computer, you might miss out. It's finding that right balance, it's a risk versus reward."" ",,,,"As new vehicles become more like computers, what car shoppers need to know about protecting their data"

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

In 2022, households in the bottom 25% by wealth had a $3,500 median net worth, according to the SCF. By comparison, the top 10% had a $3.8 million net worth.

Social Security benefits are funded via payroll taxes and assets held in a federal trust fund. However, demographic trends have Congress is likely to intervene and the current benefit formula is unlikely to change for current and near retirees, experts said. Globally, Americans seem to trail residents of other nations when it comes to sentiment around retirement preparedness, the CNBC survey found. CNBC polled residents from Australia, France, Germany, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, in addition to the U.S. About 74% of respondents in France, 70% in Singapore and 65% in Mexico report being on schedule for retirement planning and savings, for example, the poll found.

Among U.S. respondents in the CNBC survey, some of the most common components to feeling financially secure included having no outstanding debts (59%), accumulating ""high levels"" of savings (47%) and owning their own home (45%).

"The stock market could hit a milestone if the Dow Jones Industrial Average However, even as stocks have climbed higher, investors are worried there could be a pullback, financial advisors say. They're not alone in those concerns. A ""It does feel like we're at an inflection point where things could go either way,"" said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. After a mostly uninterrupted market rally over the past four or five months, it would not be surprising to see a pullback, said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. That would more likely come in the form of a temporary correction rather than a prolonged bear market, he said. For investors who have gravitated toward cash, certificates of deposit, or bonds, a pullback may be an opportunity to deploy those funds in the market, Kourkafas said. If you're investing toward your retirement or other life goals, it's best to avoid trying to time the market, said Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and the CEO and founder of ""The stock market is a long-term investment,"" said Jenkin, who is also a member of Investors are jittery that the presidential election results may throw the markets off track, But experts say those worries are misguided. ""It is really very hard to find any evidence in the data that politics is a long-term determinant of market performance,"" Kourkafas said. However, there may be increased volatility in the months preceding the election, he said. What's unique this time around is we are already familiar with both of the likely candidates — current President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump — and the markets have performed equally well under both leaders, he said. Instead, the outlook may depend more on other factors such as interest rates, corporate earnings and economic growth, he said. Financial advisors including Louis Barajas, a CFP and enrolled agent, said their clients are concerned the election may affect their portfolios. ""I tell them, 'Listen, presidents come, presidents go, the economy's going to change. But in the long term, the market tends to be up,'"" said Barajas, who is CEO of Barajas said he steers his clients to focus on their personal goals rather than on outside events. Today's market uncertainty is a reminder of the value of humility, said Morningstar's Benz. And the best way to express humility in portfolios is to diversify, she said. ""No matter what happens, we're reasonably well protected,"" Benz said. For young investors, that may mean moving away from U.S. stocks to non-U.S. holdings, she said. That may be done through a fund that reflects global market capitalization, such as the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF. Older investors may want to take advantage of higher fixed-income yields and add safer assets to their portfolios, she said. That can include cash and short- and intermediate-term high-quality bonds to build a runway to spend from, even if stocks do go down. ""You can have a safer portfolio and expect to earn a decent rate of return today,"" Benz said. If you're already in retirement and spending from your portfolio, it's worth having those safeguards in place. Finding the right mix of assets will depend on your personal timeline. For financial goals that aren't at least five years away, it makes no sense to invest in the stock market, Jenkin said. To test your own portfolio allocation based on your age, Jenkin suggested following the rule of 120 – subtract your age from that number to find out how you should be invested. So if you're 60 years old, for example, a 60% allocation to stocks may make sense. When it comes to revisiting your portfolio allocations, it's wise to set your own schedule rather than react to market or other news events. ""Make a plan to do that once a year or so,"" Benz said.

"The Despite its smaller scope than President Biden is planning to provide details of his new debt forgiveness plan during a speech Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The president likely wants to start forgiving debt for many student borrowers ahead of the election in November. Almost half of all voters, or 48%, say canceling student loan debt is an important issue to them in the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, Forgiving student debt could especially help Biden with young voters, a demographic he's been struggling with. Around 70% of Gen Z respondents said student debt cancelation was important to them in the election. More from Personal Finance: The president's Immediately after the Supreme Court struck down Biden's $400 billion student loan forgiveness plan last June, his administration began working on a revised assistance package. The Biden administration believes its updated plan will survive legal challenges this time for several reasons. One, it's far narrower than its first attempt, which would have impacted as many as 40 million Americans. ""I think it would be easier to justify in front of a court that is skeptical of broad authority,"" said It is also using a different law — the Higher Education Act rather than the Heroes Act of 2003 — as its legal justification. The HEA was The Heroes Act was passed in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and grants the president broad power to revise student loan programs during national emergencies. The conservative justices didn't buy that argument. ″'Can the Secretary use his powers to abolish $430 billion in student loans, completely canceling loan balances for 20 million borrowers, as a pandemic winds down to its end?'"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion for Lastly, the Biden administration has now turned to the rulemaking process to deliver its relief. The president previously attempted to cancel the debt through executive action. As part of the rulemaking process, a team of negotiators met four times to try to establish the new parameters of the updated policy. The final session concluded in February. Based on the timeline of regulatory changes, the proposal will likely become public within weeks, Kantrowitz said. ""Typically at the end of the negotiated rulemaking, a month or so later you have publication of the proposal,"" he said. There will then be a public comment period, which is likely to last for at least 30 days. ",,,,Biden administration will soon roll out a sweeping new student loan forgiveness plan

More from Personal Finance: However, Mortgage Bankers Association President and CEO Bob Broeksmit said capping rent increases would only worsen the housing-affordability crisis. ""Rent control has consistently proven to be a failed policy that discourages new construction, distorts market pricing, and leads to a degradation of the quality of rental housing — the exact opposite of what is currently needed in markets throughout the country,"" Broeksmit said. Here's what renters should know about the new protection, which was The cap applies to units that receive funding from the To learn if you are in such a unit, you can look on your lease — check for the word ""tax credit"" or the letters ""LIHTC"" — or ask your landlord, said Shamus Roller, the executive director of the National Housing Law Project.

This will help ""keep seniors, families with children, people with disabilities and the lowest-income tenants in their homes,"" Roller said.

"Housing costs are outpacing median household incomes in the U.S., further straining affordability. Would-be homebuyers need to earn $113,520 a year to afford the typical house in the U.S. That is 35% more than what the typical household earns annually, which is $84,072, according to a ""Since the pandemic, affordability has just totally collapsed,"" said Chen Zhao, a senior economist at Redfin. February 2021 was the last month when the typical household earned more money than it needed to afford the median home. There's been a deficit ever since, Zhao said. More from Personal Finance: ""That deficit hit a peak in October of 2023,"" she added. ""The reason why it hit a peak then is because that's when mortgage rates peaked as well."" Meanwhile, home prices also remained high because of an inventory crunch: the median sale price for a house was $412,778 in February 2024, according to Redfin. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, The average household fell short $29,448 to afford a home in February, The affordability deficit narrowed because mortgage rates have been on a consistent decline since the last peak in October, according to Zhao. At that peak, the average 30-year fixed ""It's been a pretty big change since last October,"" Zhao said. Other reasons such as seasonal pricing may be reflected, as home prices tend to decline in the winter months, said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. However, potential buyers are still on the sidelines, said Veronica Fuentes, a certified financial planner at Northwestern Mutual. ""They're either holding off or they're taking their time,"" she said. Recent layoffs in the technology industry have affected some of her clients' attitudes, Fuentes said. While her clients may not be on the chopping block, seeing their co-workers get laid off has made many of them more cautious. ""If you were laid off, could you still afford this mortgage? Do you have six months [of] emergency savings or even a year [of] emergency savings? ... Can you still afford the mortgage for six months if you have no job?"" Fuentes said. In a time when a potential buyer needs to earn about $114,000 a year to afford a median-priced house in the U.S., a starter home would make the most sense for price-sensitive buyers, experts say. A potential buyer should make about $76,000 a year to afford a Starter homes are hard to come by. Home builders over the past 15 years or so have moved away from building entry-level homes, said Ostrowski. For almost the entire second half of the 20th century, someone could buy a home for $120,000 in many parts of the U.S., he said. ""That just doesn't exist anymore,"" Ostrowski said. Buyers could seek lower costs in certain markets in the U.S. There are 13 metropolitan areas where buyers might afford the typical home without earning six figures, Redfin found. In Detroit, the typical household needed to earn $46,168 to afford the median-priced home in February, making it the most affordable market in the country. It was followed by Cleveland ($58,186), Pittsburgh ($61,603), St. Louis ($66,755) and Philadelphia ($73,182).

"There's a student loan forgiveness opportunity available to many borrowers, but they'll have to act by April 30 to qualify, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The U.S. Department of Education is conducting a one-time adjustment of borrowers' payments this summer, and those who ""The one-time adjustment is designed to count more of the payments you made, so they can be added to the payments required for cancellation,"" the CFPB says. Here's what to know. Income-driven repayment plans, Borrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan. One complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. ""They get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,"" he said. That can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans. More from Personal Finance: Now, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle. This could be a good deal for many, experts say. For example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness. Consolidating could lead them to immediately qualify for forgiveness on all of those loans, experts say, even though they'd normally need to wait at least another 14 years for full relief. Usually, a student loan consolidation restarts a borrowers' forgiveness timeline, making it a terrible move for those working toward cancellation. But the Biden administration has changed that program detail through April 30. All federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loans, Parent Plus loans and Perkins Loans, Kantrowitz said. You can apply for a ""So long as the application is submitted by April 30, they should be fine, even if the servicers take longer to process it,"" Kantrowitz said. Some borrowers who took out small amounts may even be eligible for cancellation after as few as 10 years' worth of payments, if they enroll in the new income-driven repayment option, known as the Consolidating your loans shouldn't increase your monthly payment, since your bill under an income-driven repayment plan is based on your earnings and not your total debt, Kantrowitz said. The new interest rate will be a weighted average of the rates across your loans. Before consolidating, it may be a good idea to get a complete payment history of each loan, so that you can later make sure you're getting the full credit you're entitled to, said You should be able to get a history of your payments at The payment history counts when your loans first entered repayment, not when the loan was borrowed, Rubin said. If a borrower believes there is an issue with their payment count, they can talk to their loan servicer or submit a complaint with the Department of Education's You should never have to pay a fee to consolidate your loan, the CFPB says.

Myrivili said she believes that extreme heat is often overlooked ""Heat, I believe it to the bottom of my heart, is going to be the number one public health challenge that we will be dealing with in the next decade. And we need to prepare for it now,"" Myrivili told CNBC via videoconference. ""We can — but we really need to make it a priority."" Heat is the The CDC Older adults, young children and people with chronic diseases are recognized as among the most at risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. The CDC warns that even young and healthy people can be affected. The first person in the world to be assigned as a CHO was Jane Gilbert, who was appointed in 2021 to oversee Florida's most populous county, Miami-Dade. The CHO role was created by the Atlantic Council's Arsht-Rock Resilience Center, a U.S.-based think tank that aims to support 1 billion people with resilience solutions by 2030. ""We have relatively high [air-conditioning] penetration, but with our rising temperatures, electricity bills are just through the roof. We've also had the electricity rates go up. AC can be over 50% of what the electricity bill so people are choosing between AC and putting food on the table for their families,"" Gilbert told CNBC. A coastal metropolis in the southern U.S., Miami is internationally known for its vulnerability to For six months of the year, Gilbert said temperatures in Miami exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius) almost daily, posing a particularly big problem for To help reduce the risks to the county's population of 2.7 million, Gilbert said her team's action plan focused on informing and preparing people for extreme heat, helping to cool homes affordably and working to cool community neighborhoods to tackle the so-called "" In practice, Gilbert said the measures included broad-scale marketing campaigns targeting the zip codes and demographics known to be most at risk, working with the national weather service and emergency management teams to update advisory and warning levels. They also involved installing 1,700 efficient AC units in public housing and ensuring that new affordable housing requires the most efficient cooling systems, such as cool and solar-ready roofs, to keep utility costs down. ""We want to address the root cause of this problem while we're helping people adapt,"" Gilbert said. ""All of us here have grown up in a typically hot and humid environment. We are used to the heat so that makes it really hard to distinguish between normal heat and unsafe heat,"" Bushra Afreen, CHO for Dhaka North in Bangladesh, told CNBC via videoconference. Afreen, who became Dhaka North's CHO in May last year, said stark income inequality in the country's largest city meant excessive heat was not a universally similar experience. ""When you combine that with fragile urban systems like drainage and power outages and poor health management and poor health systems and poor education systems, you get a very bad stew."" Alongside planting thousands of trees in Dhaka North's informal settlements and reintroducing a culture of water fountains in the city, Afreen said her team would roll out a pilot project in one city settlement to create green nooks and corners for reprieve. Afreen said it would be important to consider the type of trees to plant, such as citrus or neem trees to ward off mosquitoes ""Right now, the two reactions that we're seeing most are 'good job, keep it up, we need more awareness,'"" Afreen said. ""And the other kind is, 'oh, you're going to decrease the heat? Good luck.'"" Tiffany Crawford, co-CHO of Melbourne, told CNBC that extreme heat kills more people in Australia than bushfires, floods and storms. ""There's a reason for that, and it's the lag in the data,"" she said. Crawford, who works alongside Krista Milne as CHOs of Melbourne, said the true scale of heat-related deaths and illnesses often doesn't became clear until health authorities have pored through hospital admissions and ambulance data. With a population of roughly 5 million, the southeastern Australian city of Melbourne is known for its mild and temperate climate — but Crawford says it is prone to spates of summer heatwaves that last for several days and offer scant reprieve through the night. ""There's an extreme northerly wind blows that is just ferocious. I liken it to going outside and it's like someone left the oven door open or the heater on all night and forgot to turn it off,"" Crawford said. Some of the short-term interventions that have been put into place in Melbourne include extending public library and pool hours and rolling out so-called cool kits, which contain water bottles, neck towels and old-fashioned fans. Looking ahead, Crawford said the city was in conversation with Google to provide constituents with so-called online-mapped ""cool routes,"" which help users navigate the city by taking advantage of existing shade or canopy cover. ""In places like Europe, the dialogue in the media is a bit different, the heat is shocking. Whereas in Australia, the heat is something that was consistently lived with, and we will continue to live with it, but it is those variables, like any climate response, they are becoming more and more pronounced,"" Crawford said. ""We need to plan around that."" ",,,,"From Miami to Melbourne, a quiet revolution is underway to fend off a silent and invisible killer"
"The idea of using pre-assembled components in housebuilding is Modern tech-enabled versions of modular housing promise a faster, more sustainable solution to housing crises, according to experts. But the sector has seen better adoption in some countries compared to others where it has failed to scale — such as the U.K. Prefabrication has existed in many forms, from the Fast forward a century and entire modules can be built in factories to then be combined to create houses in The fact that modular housing is also made in a controlled factory environment means less waste is generated, while also resulting in more Building entire sections in one place also means fewer delivery trips to sites, Shepherd explained. A 2022 Another study by academics at the University of Cambridge and Edinburgh Napier University, published in 2022, found that modular home construction can result in Despite these benefits, the sector has seen a number of setbacks in recent years and it remains relatively nascent in the U.K. and U.S. In January, it was reported that U.K. firm Modulous had Jonatan Pinkse, professor of sustainable business at King's College London, highlighted that part of the challenge for modular construction firms is that they first have to spend money on building a factory in which to construct modules and then need to have the projects in the pipeline to pay for this investment. He suggested that this presented more difficulty when coupled with the headwinds that also affected the wider construction sector, including higher energy costs and interest rates, as well as a cost-of-living crisis in many nations prompting people to hold off on house buying. ""And if you then can't profit from a market that is actually going up, but instead is going down, then the problem is simply that [firms] can't earn back their money fast enough, and investors then lose their trust in the business model,"" Pinkse told CNBC. Pinkse was one of the co-authors on Suzanne Peters, who also co-authored the research and is a research associate at Alliance Manchester Business School, told CNBC that the construction sector more broadly is a ""very tough business"" with a higher amount of failures versus other industries. Provisional Similarly, Daniel Paterson, director of government affairs at Make UK Modular, said that the modular housing sector had faced a ""series of unfortunate events,"" as the industry had essentially only launched in the U.K. in its current format in 2016/17. He explained that firms then need around 18 months to build factories, meaning it wasn't long before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, along with the economic headwinds that followed. Perceptions based on previous versions of prefabrication was another issue, according to Richard Valentine-Selsey, head of European living research and consultancy at Savills Research. He told CNBC that, in the U.K., there is the ""1960s hangover from prefabrication and the kind of connotations that has with lower quality, things that don't last and all the kind of negative impacts of that from the building boom post-war."" In addition, he said that the ""construction industry is quite a conservative beast and finds it very challenging at times to change and think forward and innovate unless their forced to do it, which has kind of led to flirtation with new methods but no kind of wholesale change towards delivering using modular."" Sweden and Japan are the countries cited as By comparison, a Make UK Modular In Sweden, one of the major players in this space is BoKlok, which is jointly owned by construction firm Skanska and homes and furniture company Ikea, and has been around since the mid-1990s. Shepherd pointed out that Sweden is also ""not a country where you can build 12 months of the year."" ""They have very deep winters with limited daylight, so there is an incentive to look at an alternative construction process to keep people working all year, to get houses delivered at the volume needed,"" he explained. Valentine-Selsey said that in Japan there was also a difference in the approach to residential buildings. ""In Japan, the value of the building depreciates over about 30 years, so by the end of that you kind of knock it down and rebuild it because it is worthless,"" he explained, making new building methods useful, given that the delivery of new homes is higher. Looking at these examples, could methods such as modular help tackle the U.K.'s affordable housing shortage? The current U.K. government has the target of building 300,000 homes a year, but ""That's 300,000 houses a year, and there is zero chance … of that happening if there is not some form different approach adopted,"" Shepherd said. Looking ahead, Valentine-Selsey said he was an ""optimist"" in his outlook for the modular sector. ""I think we're probably going to see an uptake again over the next five to 10 years,"" he said. However, he believed that greater adoption of other types of MMC, such as panelized solutions, was more likely, but thought ""modular will form part of that new mix of delivery.""

"A series of climate records last year gave new meaning to the phrase ""off the charts,"" the United Nation's weather agency said Tuesday, warning that the planet is now on the brink of surpassing a key warming threshold. In its annual ""State of the Global Climate"" report, researchers at the World Meteorological Organization outlined how extreme weather events in 2023 wreaked havoc for millions of people across the globe and inflicted billions of dollars in economic losses. The WMO said records were broken, and in some cases, smashed, for indicators such as greenhouse gas levels, ocean heat and acidification, sea level rise, Antarctic Sea ice cover and glacier retreat. It confirmed The global average temperature in 2023 stood at 1.45 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, researchers said, marginally below the key warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The 1.5 degrees Celsius level is widely recognized as an indicator of when climate impacts become increasingly harmful to people and the planet, as outlined in the Extreme temperatures are ""Never have we been so close — albeit on a temporary basis at the moment — to the 1.5°C lower limit of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a statement. ""The WMO community is sounding the Red Alert to the world,"" she said. ""Climate change is about much more than temperatures. What we witnessed in 2023, especially with the unprecedented ocean warmth, glacier retreat and Antarctic sea ice loss, is cause for particular concern."" The report comes shortly after the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service The EU climate monitor's findings, published last month, did not represent a break of the 2015 Paris Agreement, however. The climate accord aims to ""limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" over the long term. Nonetheless, scientists have ""Earth's issuing a distress call,"" United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Tuesday. ""The latest State of the Global Climate report shows a planet on the brink. Fossil fuel pollution is sending climate chaos off the charts,"" he added. ""Sirens are blaring across all major indicators. … Some records aren't just chart-topping, they're chart-busting. And changes are speeding up."" The world has already warmed by The WMO's report said that on an average day in 2023, almost one-third of the world's oceans were gripped by a marine heat wave, harming vital ecosystems and food systems. Renewable energy generation was described as one ""glimmer of hope,"" however. The WMO said renewable energy generation had surged to the forefront of climate action in 2023, citing its potential to help achieve decarbonization targets. Indeed, researchers said renewable capacity additions increased nearly 50% in 2023 to a total of 510 gigawatts. The agency said this was the highest observed rate over the past two decades.

"Reservations for Italy's new ""La Dolce Vita Orient Express"" train open Tuesday. Luxury train enthusiasts may want to lock in the current rate now — before it climbs any higher. Starting rates for a one-night journey on the luxury train increased from But starting rates have now jumped to That's an eye-watering 75% price increase in a 16-month period. The train is set to start running in the spring of 2025, according to Accor, the French multinational hospitality company that operates the train. Accor did not directly answer CNBC's question as to the reason behind the steep price hike. A representative said, ""Pricing evolves according to occupancy, season, route, and cabin type."" However, again, the train isn't operating yet. Ticket prices are still lower than another train using the ""Orient Express"" moniker in Europe — the Dave Goodger, managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics company, said rising prices are caused by consumers' continued willingness to pay higher rates for luxury experiences. But, he said, that's likely not the only reason. ""Luxury travel demand is reflected in some continued price increases,"" he said. ""However, the price increases are not profiteering and are broadly in line with rising costs, including higher staff costs as well as increased debt service requirements."" Goodger called the La Dolce Vita train's price increase ""something of an outlier,"" but also noted it's reflective of the unique service it provides. Accor's La Dolce Vita Orient Express is set to run The ""La Dolce Vita"" train — which translates to ""the sweet life"" — channels the era of Italian glamour captured by Federico Fellini's famed 1960 movie of the same name.

"In this article The travel industry is largely back on track. But high prices in the luxury sector, which rose in the wake of the Covid pandemic, aren't returning to normal. In fact, they're growing higher by the month. Luxury hotel rates reached ""peak levels"" this year, with average daily rates up 70% compared to 2019, according to the luxury travel company Virtuoso. ""July 2024 stands out with the highest rate, marking an 85% increase compared to July 2019,"" a company representative told CNBC Travel. The price for luxury train travel is also soaring, with rates for Accor's yet-to-be-opened La Dolce Vita Orient-Express Rates on another luxury European train, Belmond's Belmond has not yet responded to CNBC's request for comment, but Accor told CNBC Travel that pricing and plans ""are constantly evolving."" Travel prices have increased for many of the same reasons that have affected other industries: inflation, rising labor costs, supply chain issues and debt service rates. But travelers' unflinching willingness to pay the new rates means the ""old"" prices for a five-star holiday may be a thing of the past. As inflation and rising costs abate, luxury travel prices are holding firm. That's because at significantly higher rates, ""the demand is there,"" said Henry Harteveldt, president of the travel market research company, Atmosphere Research Group ""Money is almost no object for some of these guests,"" Harteveldt told "" Wealthy travelers also value new and different experiences, such as luxury train travel, he said. ""They want something exclusive ... and these companies are going to capitalize on it while they can."" For price-conscious travelers, competition will temper costs at the budget and mid-scale sectors, said Harteveldt. ""For those of us who live on planet Earth… budget airfares have been coming down because competition there is growing,"" he said. ""Budget and midscale hotels are among the fastest growing in the hotel sector. They too introduce lower pricing as they open or expand the number of properties in those categories."" Booking early can save money on airfares, but hotel pricing works differently, he said. ""With hotels, you either book early or wait until within two weeks of your travel date,"" said Harteveldt. ""I personally book refundable and changeable hotel rates [because] I have noticed that, in some cases, hotel rates can go down... closer to the check-in date, if demand isn't where they expected it to be."" Overall, travel demand remains strong, yet surveys show some travelers are beginning to buckle under the costs. But this isn't affecting the luxury travel sphere at the same level, said Dave Goodger, managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics company. ""The luxury boom continues despite the flatlining economic activity in some major developed markets,"" he told CNBC Travel. The industry continues to see upward pricing pressure for luxury experiences, he said. ""This has come as some travellers have traded up for more luxury experiences,"" he said.

It is Hydrogen has Green hydrogen, a process that involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity, is one exception from what's known as the hydrogen It's within this context that momentum has been building around geologic hydrogen. Exploratory efforts are now underway in countries such as the U.S., Canada, Australia, France, Spain, Colombia, South Korea and others. Research The consulting firm, which described the pursuit of geologic hydrogen as a ""white gold rush,"" said the hype stems from hopes that the untapped resource could be a ""gamechanger"" in the clean energy transition. ""I would say this is something relatively old and new in a way,"" Minh Khoi Le, head of hydrogen research at Rystad Energy, told CNBC via videoconference. ""The first project that found hydrogen was a while ago, but it never picked up from there, right? People never seriously tried to go for exploration."" The Almost two decades later, subsequent exploration at the site Last year, researchers Geoffrey Ellis, a research geologist at the Energy Resources Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), told CNBC that there could be a vast amount of naturally occurring hydrogen buried in underground reservoirs around the world. Based on current understanding, Ellis said there is likely to be about 5 trillion metric tons of geologic hydrogen in Earth's interior, although most of this is likely to be too deep or too far offshore to be economically recovered. Nonetheless, Ellis said that just a few percent of geologic hydrogen recovery might well be enough to supply all projected demand for 200 years. ""The potential is there but we've got to do the work,"" Ellis said via videoconference, adding that more investment is necessary to accelerate early-stage research and development. The U.S. Department of Energy last month ""Natural hydrogen has created a lot of excitement at the moment but in terms of potential I think it is still a little bit uncertain because none of these projects have actually started producing or extracting hydrogen — except for that one in Mali,"" Rystad Energy's Le told CNBC. Le said there were still ""a lot of question marks around the whole story about natural hydrogen,"" but there appeared to be ""some substance"" behind the hype. ""If some of these numbers that certain institutes, like the USGS, about the potential volume that you can extract … come true, it can actually play quite a significant role,"" he added. Not everyone's convinced. Some have expressed skepticism about the clean energy potential of natural hydrogen. ""Sometimes we want to run before we can walk,"" Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told CNBC via videoconference. The first near-term priority for hydrogen, Jaller-Makarewicz said, should be looking for ways to replace so-called grey hydrogen with green hydrogen.

Separately, the Hydrogen Science Coalition, a group of academics, scientists and engineers seeking to bring an evidence-based view to hydrogen's role in the energy transition, What's more, the coalition says there are environmental concerns about the extraction process, and transportation and distribution challenges mean geologic hydrogen is not likely to be found where it is needed most. ""Considering findings to date, what we know about geologic hydrogen systems, and the fact that favourable settings appear rare, the odds of finding geologic hydrogen that can be extracted at the scale of large natural gas developments looks relatively slim,"" the coalition said on March 14.

""In this context, it (the OAS) expresses solidarity with those who were victims of the inappropriate actions that affected the Mexican Embassy in Ecuador,"" according to the statement released Saturday. The organization added that it deemed a meeting of its permanent council ""necessary to address the issue,"" but did not set a date. Bárcena on Friday said Mexico would take the case to the International Court of Justice ""to denounce Ecuador's responsibility for violations of international law.""

""People have really adopted the flexible working style, and it resonates with travelers,"" Virgin Voyages' CEO Nirmal Saverimuttu told The Booking the ""Season Pass"" is 30% cheaper than booking four week-long cruises back to back, according to Virgin's website. Travelers can also swap out travel companions for different legs of the cruise, said Saverimuttu, as long as they are 18 or older, in line with Virgin Voyages' Within 24 hours of announcing the Season Pass, more than 2,000 people registered interest in it, said Saverimuttu. When bookings opened, spots on the month-long cruise — which stops at places like Cannes, Rome and Ibiza — sold out in 48 hours, a company representative told CNBC Travel. That prompted Virgin Voyages to open additional spots for remote workers on a second cruise ship this summer. The ""Season Pass"" cruises will sail on Virgin's Scarlet Lady and Resilient Lady ships, each of which can accommodate around 2,700 guests. Cruises are scheduled to sail from June to September this year. The popularity of Virgin's Season Pass cruise stems from the broader shift to remote work since the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are in the midst of a massive transformation in how, what, and where we do our jobs,"" KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, told CNBC Travel. ""There is no putting the work-from-home genie back in the bottle. Firms who try too aggressively to do so, lose a lot of their access to top talent and the diversity of their workforce."" Saverimuttu said most of the digital workers who have booked the cruise are in their mid-50s and are employed in full-time remote roles. He said the idea for the program came directly from Branson himself, after he learned passengers were taking extended trips while working remotely on the company's ships. He attributed the program's quickly growing popularity to Branson's ""magic touch"" for understanding today's consumers. ""The response has really been phenomenal. It's really surprised us,"" he said. ""But you know, maybe I shouldn't be surprised because it was one of Richard's ideas.""

"In this article A car loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot, but electric vehicles are taking this adage to a new level. That's becoming a major barrier to wider adoption, according to some industry and investment experts. A recent While lower used EV prices could increase their desirability to some buyers, they can also reduce demand for new electric vehicles, according to Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. ""The value a new car loses in the first few years is the single most expensive aspect of owning a new vehicle,"" he said, explaining that ""as more new car shoppers become aware of the massive drop in EV values they will be less interested in buying one."" Speaking to CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Monday, David Kuo, stock analyst and co-founder at the Smart Investor, said that the inability of EVs to retain value had kept him from investing in the industry. According to Kuo, EVs are analogous to other consumer electronics like laptops and cell phones in that they tend to lose value and relevance quickly after being sold. ""The same [depreciation] is going to happen to electric vehicles; it'll probably cost you $20,000, $30,000 to buy one, but in a year's time it will depreciate much faster than an internal combustion engine car,"" he said. Industry insiders have also flagged EV resale problems. Kuo further argued that the software and computing capabilities of used EVs may become outdated and incompatible with updates by the time they are sold or even beforehand. That will be a ""lightbulb moment"" when buyers realize they paid too much in the first place, he added. Despite EVs' apparent depreciation issue, its causes might have less to do with the technology itself and more to do with market conditions. According to iSeeCars, dramatic drops in used electric vehicle values in the U.S. have largely been driven by aggressive price cuts by Tesla is the dominant EV seller in the U.S. and as a result of lower prices for its new EVs, buyers are less likely to entertain the same price levels for used alternatives. ""If [Elon Musk] continues to reduce Tesla prices in an effort to stimulate sales, he'll continue to pull the entire market down, as he did over the past 15 months,"" iSeeCars' Brauer said. In an October earnings call, Musk defended the price cuts, emphasizing the importance of cost to consumers. ""It's not an optional thing for most people; it is a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable so people can buy them,"" he said. In the following quarter's earnings call in January, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said the company would continue to focus on its cost reduction efforts in 2024. Since then, the EV price war between Tesla and Chinese competitors has Additionally, overproduction of EVs relative to demand has created excessive supply, making it unlikely for new and used EV prices to rebound in the near term, according to Brauer. What is an ongoing issue for the EV market, however, may be a boon for electric and combustion powered hybrids, which are showing increasing strength in new and used vehicle markets. The average price for used hybrid vehicles fell only 6.5% or $2,135 last year — a fraction of the decline of the average EV. ""Hybrids are an excellent stepping stone between gasoline and electric cars, and I expect to see them increasing in popularity over the next 10 years,"" Brauer said.

"Israel said on Saturday its special forces had recovered the body of a hostage killed while being held captive in Gaza, as the Palestinian enclave's dominant Islamist movement Hamas said it would take part in a new round of Almost six months into the war, Israel has faced protests at home demanding a deal to free the dwindling number of live hostages from Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border rampage. Western countries, meanwhile, have voiced outrage over what they see as an unacceptably high Palestinian civilian toll and the accompanying humanitarian crisis. The body of Elad Katzir, a 47-year-old Israeli farmer, was unearthed by commandos in southern Khan Younis overnight, the military said. He had been killed by his Palestinian Islamic Jihad captors and buried there in mid-January, it said, citing intelligence information about which it declined to elaborate. Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, had no immediate comment. Katzir was among 253 people dragged into Gaza by Hamas-led gunmen who killed some 1,200 others in southern Israel, according to official tallies, sparking an offensive that medics in the enclave say has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians. His father Avraham was killed in their kibbutz, Nir Oz, and his mother Hanna was also taken hostage but freed in November under a truce. Qatari and Egyptian mediators have been trying to secure another deal that might return some of the 129 remaining hostages in a longer ceasefire in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry on Saturday reported one of the lowest daily death tolls in six months, saying 46 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. The Gaza-based ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants in its reports but local health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians. Israel says at least a third are fighters. Hamas on Saturday said its fighters targeted three Israeli tanks in Khan Younis with missiles, inflicting casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, though it said earlier that troops had engaged with gunmen in the area. The World Health Organisation said its team had managed to reach Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where Israeli special forces conducted a two-week raid against suspected militants, leaving a wasteland of destroyed buildings. The team saw at least five dead bodies at the complex, most of which had suffered extensive destruction. ""Even restoring minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible,"" said a statement from WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Al-Shifa, the Gaza Strip's biggest hospital before the war, was one of the few healthcare facilities that had been partially operational in the north of enclave before the raid. Angered by an Israeli air strike that killed aid workers in Gaza, U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday urged an ""immediate ceasefire"" and for Israel to boost humanitarian relief measures. Israel approved the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of its Ashdod port following the U.S. criticism, measures welcomed on Saturday by U.N. aid coordinator Jamie McGoldrick. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid told N12's Meet the Press on Saturday that he was travelling to Washington where he will meet U.S. officials next week. The Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether senior officials will meet Lapid. Hamas said it would send a delegation to Cairo on Sunday for a new round of mediated talks. Israel was undecided on whether to attend, an Israeli official said, citing concern that the event would be ""more political theatre than actual progress"". Hamas wants any deal to bring about an end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israel has said that, after any truce, it would topple Hamas, which is sworn to its destruction. A rally in Jerusalem calling on leaders to secure a hostage release was set to take place on Sunday, which marks six months since the Oct. 7 attack, and anti-government protesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday called for an election. In a Jan. 8 video posted by Islamic Jihad online, Katzir said: ""I was close to dying more than once. It's a miracle I'm still alive ... I want to tell my family that I love them very much and I miss them very much."" Based on various sources of information, Israel has declared at least 35 hostages as dead in Gaza captivity. Palestinian factions have said some were killed in Israeli strikes. While confirming this in several cases, Israel says that, in others, hostages whose bodies were recovered bore signs of execution.

"The widespread arrival of generative artificial intelligence has prompted alarm from many quarters. A But doom is only one interpretation of AI. According to experts paid to predict the future, the arrival of AI is more likely than not to offer a roadmap out of humanity's worst impulses and create a better, more equitable world. That's the rosy scenario outlined in ""We are now at a point in time where science and technology can enable the advancement of humanity in a way we have not seen in a long time,"" said Frank Diana, managing partner and principal futurist at Tata. ""We are in a place we haven't been since the second industrial revolution,"" he said, predicting that AI's widespread arrival will herald innovation in This view is a world away from some prominent tech leaders who have Diana says the doomsday scenarios distract and undermine the technology's potential. ""I think, honestly, the conversation around conscious robots and artificial superintelligence gets in the way,"" Diana said. ""If AI is managed correctly, we will instead talk about all the great things AI can do for humanity."" He said today's often negative view of AI in the popular imagination has roots in the 1970s when Hollywood shifted towards more ominous themes that matched the country's mood. But before that, he said, technology was viewed as something that could one day deliver utopia. Author and futurist Bernard Marr, who was not involved in the Tata survey, echoed the more optimistic thinking. ""I see all the amazing benefits AI can bring and I see it every day. I believe AI is the most powerful technology humans have ever had access to,"" Marr said, a power he believes can be used to bulldoze inequities and challenges in health, education, and climate change. ""We are a very long way from AI becoming sentient, if ever. But AI is very, very good at doing things that in the past only humans could do,"" Marr said. ""The mundane is a waste of our power as humans. AI will allow us to focus on the amazing power that makes us human,"" he added. He sees AI's role evolving into being a constant co-pilot rather than staying awake at night worrying about robots taking over the planet. ""AI will make doctor and patient relationships much better,"" Marr said, describing how the insurance and regulatory paperwork that bogs doctors down now will be taken over by AI, freeing up the practitioner to spend more time with patients. ""I don't see AI as anything scary; all the systems being developed are not working against humans but are making us better."" Given AI's power, regulations, laws, and safeguards are necessary to prevent abuse. ""But already you are starting to see that happen,"" Marr said, referring So why the widespread fear? When people talk about sentient AI, they usually turn immediately to the ominous. Sentient, however, can also be benevolent or values-neutral, but that is not the AI people usually think about. The reason people fear AI lies in our very humanity, said Kelsey Latimer, a Florida-based clinical psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorder. She said that humans are hard-wired to brace themselves for the worst. ""From an evolutionary point of view, we are primed to see the negative and scary things so that we could see the predators coming toward us and respond,"" Latimer said. If we view something as unfavorable and it turns out to be positive, no harm is done. If we view something as positive but it turns out to be negative, then we often need to prepare for the consequences. Futurists like Diana and Marr predict the consequences of AI will be positive ones. ""With the use of AI, the passion and the creativity that we as humans can do will start to shine through,"" Diana said.

The event, billed as the ""Inaugural Leadership Dinner,"" sends a signal of a resurgence of Trump and the Republican Party's fundraising, ""This has been some incredible evening before it even starts because people — they wanted to contribute to a cause of making America great again, and that's what's happened,"" Trump said briefly to reporters as he arrived at the event with his wife Melania Trump. Trump and the GOP announced earlier in the week that they raised more than $65.6 million in March and closed out the month with $93.1 million. ""While Donald Trump has been busy awarding himself golf trophies at Mar-a-Lago and palling around with billionaires, Joe Biden has been crisscrossing the nation connecting with voters and outlining his vision to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out,"" Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement, referring to Trump's Florida residence. Campaign fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission detailing donations from Saturday's event are not expected until a mid-July filing date. Trump initially Saturday's high-dollar event hosted about 100 guests, including more than a few billionaires. Contributions to the event will go toward the Trump 47 Committee, according to the invitation, a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, state Republican parties and Save America, a political action committee that pays the bulk of Trump's legal bills. In an unusual arrangement, the fundraising agreement directs donations to first pay the maximum allowed under law to his campaign and Save America before the RNC or state parties get a cut. Donors who gave the suggested $814,600 per person or $250,000 per person will only have $5,000 of their donation go to Save America, sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cash-strapped RNC. As Trump prepared in March to install a new handpicked leadership team at the RNC, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, some members of the RNC worried that the committee's money would go toward Trump's sizable legal fees as he fights a number of court cases, including four criminal cases. The fundraising arrangement doesn't direct RNC funds to Trump's legal bills. But when checks of any amount are written to the combined campaign, the campaign and Save America get paid first by default. Co-chairs of the fundraiser include Robert Bigelow, a Las Vegas-based businessman who had supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign; New York grocery billionaire John Catsimatidis; Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment executive and head of the Small Business Administration while Trump was president; casino mogul Steve Wynn; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to the invitation. Guests were asked to contribute $814,600 per person as a ""chairman"" contributor, which came with seating at Trump's table, or $250,000 per person as a ""host committee"" contributor. Both options come with a photo opportunity and a personalized copy of Trump's coffee table book featuring photographs from his administration, ""Our Journey Together."" Three of Trump's former rivals for the GOP nomination — South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy — were expected to appear as ""special guests.""

"A paper mill in a small Mississippi town could help demonstrate whether capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing it deep underground is a viable path to fight climate change. The proposed project at Amazon The Vicksburg paper mill project is just one example of how Carbon capture and storage technology today is expensive, logistically complex and faces controversy over its role in the energy transition and safety concerns in communities where pipeline infrastructure would be expanded. The Paris-based International Energy Agency has described carbon capture and storage as ""critical"" to achieve global net-zero emissions, while also warning the oil and gas industry against using the technology as a way to maintain the status quo on fossil fuels. Some climate activists accuse the industry of simply investing in carbon capture as way to extend the use of oil and gas. The technology typically uses chemical absorption to capture carbon dioxide emitted from the chimney of an industrial plant. The emissions are condensed into a fluid for transport, normally through a pipeline, and are stored thousands of feet below ground in depleted oil wells or geological formations such as saltwater reservoirs. The challenges to implementing the technology are immense. The world needs to capture more than 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030, more than 20 times the 45 million metric tons captured in 2022, according to the IEA. By 2050, the amount of carbon that's captured needs to reach 6 billion tons — more than 130 times the 2022 level, according to the agency. But the track record of carbon capture and storage so far has been one of ""underperformance,"" with only 5% of announced projects having reached a final investment decision, according to the IEA. The industry needs to demonstrate that the technology can operate economically at scale after struggling to ramp up deployment for years, the agency says. The Vicksburg papermill project is still in an early development stage. SLB is confident that it will prove technologically viable, said Fred Majkut, senior vice president of carbon solutions at the company. The goal is to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is also economically viable, Majkut said. ""The economic viability of carbon capture and sequestration is a challenge today because the cost of building most plants in order to capture carbon dioxide are very significant,"" the executive said. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit an industrial plant, he said. For International Paper, the Vicksburg project is a potential way to produce lower carbon products for consumers who are climate conscious and a potential opportunity to benefit financially through the sale of carbon credits. ""There are examples in the marketplace where customers have the opportunity to express their preferences economically, whether that's clicking a button to say they want to abate the carbon emissions for a trip in an Uber or an airplane,"" said Adam Miklos, director of low carbon innovation at International Paper. ""Ultimately, it has the potential to reduce our emissions and, if successful, present an opportunity to sell carbon and renewable credits,"" Miklos said. The Mississippi mill is a snapshot of how the oil and gas industry is trying to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is a viable tool in the race to slash emissions, after using similar technology for decades to extract oil. The industry has used carbon storage techniques since the 1970s in a process called enhanced oil recovery, in which carbon dioxide is injected underground to create pressure that pushes more crude toward production wells. Chevron Total spending on carbon capture and storage projects is expected to reach $241 billion worldwide by 2030 if all announced projects materialize, according Rystad Energy. The United States and the United Kingdom are the leaders, with investments expected to reach $85 billion and $45 billion, respectively, by the end of the decade, according to Rystad. In the U.S., investment in carbon management technologies more than doubled to $1.2 billion in 2023, the first full year after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, according to the Cement plants, for example, produce emissions not only by burning fossil fuels, but also due to the materials used in the manufacturing process. About two-thirds of the industry's carbon dioxide emissions come from chemical reactions that occur when breaking down limestone. Cement is one of the most widely-used products globally, second only to drinking water, and is responsible for about 7% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions alone, ""Right now, these types of industries have no way to effectively decarbonize to net zero without carbon capture,"" Majkut said. ""If they want to produce cement, there will be CO2 emissions simply because of the materials that are being used."" With carbon storage already a mature commercial business, SLB is trying to tackle the capture side, which presents one of the major hurdles to scaling up the technology due to its high cost, according to Majkut. The solvent that would be used to catch carbon dioxide molecules at the Mississippi mill promises to lower the energy requirements of the capture process and make it more cost effective, he said. ""We're quite comfortable that in the next 12 to 24 months, we will be coming to market with actually that chemistry as part of our core offering and develop what we call process design packages,"" Majkut said. SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch has said carbon capture and storage will play a leading role in the company's annual revenue targets of $3 billion by 2030 and $10 billion by 2040 for its new energy portfolio. SLB this month announced a nearly $400 million investment in Aker Carbon Capture, a pure-play carbon capture company based in Norway, in an effort to accelerate deployment of the technology at commercial scale. Competitor Baker Hughes is developing direct air capture technology after acquiring a company called Mosaic Materials in 2022. Baker Hughes has not disclosed the value of the deal. The technology aims to catch low concentration carbon dioxide emissions, which are harder to capture, directly from the atmosphere as well as from industrial plants. Baker Hughes anticipates the technology will most likely come to market by the end of 2026. Baker Hughes is targeting up to $7 billion in orders by 2030 for its new energy portfolio, which includes carbon capture and storage technology. The company is forecasting a total market for its new energy business of between $60 billion and $70 billion by the end of the decade. ""By 2030, I do believe we're going to start to see these technologies start to become reasonably competitive,"" said Alessandro Bresciani, senior vice president of climate technologies at Baker Hughes. The Gulf Coast of the United States, home to enormous oil and gas and other industrial plants, is emerging as a center of carbon capture and storage investments in the U.S. Jeff Gustavson, vice president of lower carbon energies at Chevron, said the region has the potential to quickly increase use of the technology because of favorable geology for storage located close to high concentration emissions that are easier to capture at a lower cost. Some 100 million tons of carbon dioxide are emitted annually from Houston through to Port Arthur, Texas, Gustavson said. Chevron Exxon over the past two years has entered agreements to capture carbon emissions from ammonia and fertilizer producer Dan Ammann, president of low carbon solutions at Exxon, said those three contracts combined promise to remove 5 million tons of emissions annually — the equivalent of converting 2 million gas-powered cars to electric vehicles. Exxon completed its acquisition of the carbon-dioxide pipeline operator Denbury for $5 billion in late 2023. The deal gave Exxon more than 900 miles of pipeline stretching through Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that are located near at least 10 storage sites in the region. ""It gives us sort of instantaneous scale, instantaneous reach, across this huge source of emissions along the Gulf Coast,"" Ammann said of the Denbury acquisition. ""It gives us the ability to develop storage all along that pipeline as well."" Exxon says it now owns the largest carbon dioxide pipeline network in the U.S. As the infrastructure comes together, Exxon is seeing ""a very high level of interest from a lot of different emitters along the Gulf Coast,"" Ammann said. Chevron is the operator and lead investor in a flagship project called Bayou Bend, which has a 140,000 acre position of permanent carbon dioxide storage space near Port Arthur and Beaumont, Texas. The project is a joint venture with minority shareholders Negotiations are currently underway with potential customers, Gustavson said, declining to disclose names. The area is home to large petrochemical, refinery, liquid natural gas and industrial gas operations with significant carbon dioxide footprints, he said. ""Bayou Bend could be one of the largest CO2 storage projects in the world. You're talking several million tons a year of storage,"" Gustavson said. The project has the potential for even more storage capacity depending on how much technical progress is made, the executive said. While the IEA has described carbon capture and storage as ""essential"" to slash emissions in sectors like heavy industry, agency director Fatih Birol issued a sharply worded statement in November calling on the oil and gas industry to let go of the ""illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution"" to climate change. Birol's comments came on the back of an ""We're not saying carbon capture can be implemented everywhere,"" SLB's Majkut said. ""As a matter of fact, the primary way to decarbonize should be energy efficiency, scale up of renewables, and effectively carbon capture shall be used on applications that you can't easily electrify, that you can't easily decarbonize otherwise."" Increasing carbon capture and storage to meet net-zero emissions goals in the U.S. will require a massive expansion of pipeline infrastructure. The Department of Energy ""The key is the right geology close by to concentrated emissions,"" Gustavson said. ""That's where we see this scaling fastest first, but over time, we will need to build more CO2 infrastructure to be able to transport CO2 much longer distances to access the same storage."" But the permitting process is challenging because pipelines often cross state lines, requiring lengthy approval from multiple jurisdictions and creating bottlenecks, Majkut said. Pipeline expansion has faced opposition in communities where residents are Denbury said in a The Energy Department says carbon dioxide pipelines have a better safety record than natural gas pipelines and other large infrastructure such as electric transmission. There have been no deaths from carbon dioxide pipelines over the past two decades and one injury in addition to the hospitalizations from the Satartia incident, according to the Transportation Department. There are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding carbon capture and storage, said Miklos, the executive at International Paper. But the Vicksburg project is an opportunity to carefully examine the technical and economic viability and the impact on climate over a multiyear period, he said. ""The primary questions are around the ability to do this in a way that is cost effective,"" he said.

"The annual two-day ""SEC Speaks"" event kicked off Tuesday, offering clues to what the priorities will be for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming year. Sponsored by the Practising Law Institute, it is a forum where the SEC provides guidance to the legal community on rules, regulations, enforcement actions and lawsuits. The event allows the SEC to get its main messages across, and this year a key issue is ""disclosure."" ""[W]e have an obligation to update the rules of the road, always with an eye toward promoting trust as well as efficiency, competition, and liquidity in the markets,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in his introduction to the conference. Besides Gensler, all the SEC division heads and senior staff will be speaking. Based on Gensler's introductory remarks, there will be discussions about the upcoming move to shorten the securities settlement cycle from two days to one (T+1, which takes place May 28), the expansion of the definition of an exchange to include more recent trading platforms (like request-for-quote, or RFQ, electronic trading platforms), consideration of a change in the current one-penny increment for quoting stock trades to sub-penny levels, creation of a best execution standard for broker-dealers, and creation of more competition for individual investors orders (so-called payment for order flow). You often hear SEC officials say the role of the SEC is to ""protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation."" That sounds like a pretty broad mandate, and it is. Deliberately so. It came out of the disaster of the 1929 stock market crash, which was the initial event in the greatest economic catastrophe of the last 100 years: the Great Depression. Prior to 1933, and particularly in the 1920s, all sorts of securities were sold to the public with wild claims behind them, much of which were fraudulent. After the crash of 1929, Congress went looking for a cause, and fraudulent claims and lack of disclosure were high on the list. Congress then passed the Securities Act of 1933, and the following year passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC to enforce all the new laws. It also required everyone involved in the securities business (mainly brokerage firms and stock exchanges) to register with the SEC. The 1933 Act did not make it illegal to sell a bad investment. It simply required disclosure: all relevant facts about an investment were supposed to be disclosed, and investors could make up their own minds. The 1933 Act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities in the United States. This was followed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulated mutual funds (and eventually ETFs), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which required investment advisers to register with the SEC. Tuesday's conference is a chance for Gensler and his staff to tell everyone what they are doing in greater detail. The agency has six divisions, but they can be boiled down to disclosure, risk monitoring and enforcement. Risk monitoring. Disclosure. There's also a division of examinations that conducts the SEC's National Exam Program. It's just what it sounds like. The SEC identifies areas of high concern (cybersecurity, crypto, money laundering, climate change, etc.) and then monitors Corporate America (investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, etc.) to make sure they are in compliance with all the required disclosures. Current hot topics include climate change, crypto and cybersecurity. The problem is that the definition of what should be disclosed has evolved over the decades. For example, there is a bitter legal fight brewing over the recent enactment of regulations requiring companies to disclose climate risks. Many contend this was not part of the original SEC mandate. The SEC disagrees, arguing it is part of the mandate to ""protect investors."" Enforcement. These are the cops. They conduct investigations into securities laws violations, and they prosecute the civil suits in the federal courts. This division will be providing an update on the litigation the SEC is involved in, which is growing. Mutual funds, ETFs and investment advisers. Trading. Donald Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the SEC in January considerably tightened the rules around disclosure of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Trump's company, Truth Social, went public on March 22 through a merger with a SPAC known as Digital World Acquisition Corp. It is now trading as Prior to the recent rule changes, executives marketing a company to be acquired by a SPAC often made wild claims about the future profitability of these businesses — claims that would never have been possible to make had a traditional initial public offering route been used. The new SPAC rules that the SEC adopted made the target company legally liable for any statement made about future results by assuming responsibility for disclosures. Additionally, companies are provided with a ""safe harbor"" protection when they make forward-looking statements, which provide them with protection against certain legal liabilities. However, IPOs are not afforded this ""safe harbor"" protection, which is why forward-looking statements in an IPO registration are usually very cautiously worded. The rules clarified that SPACs also do not have ""safe harbor"" legal protections for forward-looking statements, which means the companies could more easily be sued. Like I said, Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the message: ""Disclosure!"" will likely be the dominant refrain.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Speaking specifically about stronger-than-expected price pressures to start the year, the central bank leader said he and his fellow officials are in no rush to ease monetary policy. ""On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,"" Powell said in remarks ahead of a question-and-answer session at Stanford University. ""We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent,"" he added. ""Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy."" The remarks come two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold benchmark short-term borrowing rates steady. In addition, the committee's post-meeting statement on March 20 included the ""greater confidence"" qualifier needed before cutting. Markets widely expect the FOMC to start easing policy this year, though they have had to recalibrate their outlook for the timing and extent of cuts as inflation has held stubbornly higher. Other economic variables, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending, have held up as well, giving the Fed time to assess the current state of affairs before moving. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ""Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,"" Powell said. ""The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path."" Other Fed officials speaking this week have made remarks consistent with the Fed's patient approach. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic Powell reiterated that decisions are being made ""meeting by meeting"" and noted only that cuts are ""likely to be appropriate ... at some point this year."" The uncertainty about rates has caused some consternation in markets, with stocks falling sharply earlier this week as Treasury yields moved higher. The market stabilized Wednesday, but traders in the fed funds futures market again repriced their rate expectations, casting some doubt on a June cut as the market-implied probability moved to about 54% at one point, according to CME Group data. Along with his comments on rates, Powell spent some time discussing Fed independence. With the presidential election campaign heating up, Powell noted the importance of steering clear of political issues. ""Our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public,"" he said. ""We will not always get it right — no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term — and nothing else."" He also talked about ""mission creep,"" specifically as it relates to some demand for the Fed to get involved in climate change issues and the preparations financial institutions take for related events.

"Managing one's personal finances can seem like a hodgepodge of never-ending checklists and rules of thumb.

Credit agencies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion determine the score using a formula that accounts for Lenders are generally more willing to give loans and better interest rates to borrowers with credit scores in the mid- to high-700s or above, Let's say a consumer wants a $300,000 fixed mortgage for a 30-year term. The average person with a credit score between 760 and 850 would get a 6.5% interest rate, according to national FICO data as of April 1. By comparison, someone with a score of 620 to 639 would get an 8.1% rate. The latter's monthly payment would cost $324 more relative to the person with a better credit score — amounting to an extra $116,000 over the life of the loan, according to FICO's Wills are basic They spell out who gets your money after you die. Wills can also stipulate who will take care of your kids and oversee your money until your children turn 18. Planning for such a grim event isn't fun — but it's essential, said Barry Glassman, CFP, founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services. ""I'm shocked by the number of well-to-do families with kids who have no will in place,"" Glassman said. Without such a legal document, state courts Taking it a step further, individuals can create trusts, which can assign more control over details like the age at which children gain access to inherited funds, Glassman said. Choosing how much money to stash away for a One household might need three months of savings while another might need a year, she said. Emergency funds include money to cover the necessities — like mortgage, rent, utility and grocery payments — in the event of an unexpected event like job loss. A single person should generally try to save at least six months' worth of emergency expenses, Elliott said. That's also true for married couples where both spouses work at the same company or in the same industry; the risk of a job loss occurring at or around the same time is relatively high, Elliott said. Meanwhile, a couple in which the spouses make a similar income but work in different fields and occupations may only need three months of expenses. If something unexpected happens to one spouse's employment, the odds are good that the couple can temporarily lean on the other spouse's income, she said. Business owners should aim to have at least a year of expenses saved since their income can fluctuate, as the Covid-19 pandemic showed, Elliott added. Tax withholding is a pay-as-you-go system. Employers estimate your annual tax bill and withhold tax from each paycheck accordingly. ""Ten out of 10 people couldn't explain how the tax withholding system works,"" said Ted Jenkin, CFP, CEO and founder of oXYGen Financial based in Atlanta. Employers partly base those withholdings on information workers supply on a W-4 form. Generally, taxpayers who get a refund during tax season withheld too much from their paychecks throughout the year. They receive those overpayments from the government via a refund. However, those who owe money to Uncle Sam didn't withhold enough to satisfy their annual tax bill and must make up the difference. People who owe money often blame their accountants or tax software instead of themselves, even though they can generally control how much is withheld, Jenkin said. Someone who owes more than $500 to $1,000 may want to change their withholding, Jenkin said. That goes for someone who gets a big refund as well; instead, they may wish to save (and earn interest on) that extra cash throughout the year, Jenkin said. Workers can fill out a new W-4 form to change their withholding. They may wish to do so upon any major life event like a marriage, divorce or birth of a child to avoid surprises come tax time. ""I think people underestimate how much money they're going to need in retirement,"" Elliott said. Many people assume their spending will decline when they retire, perhaps to roughly 60% to 70% of spending during their working years, she said. But that's not always the case. ""Yes, maybe the kids are out of the house but now that you're retired you have more time, meaning you have more time to do things,"" Elliott said. She asks clients to envision how they want to spend their lives in retirement — travel and hobbies, for example — to estimate how their spending might change. That helps guide overall savings goals. Households also don't often account for the potential need for long-term care, which can be costly, in their calculations, she said.

"BEIJING — China's real estate troubles are likely far from over and industry problems need to be addressed quickly if overall GDP growth is to pick up significantly, according to a report released Thursday by global investment firm KKR. That's one of the two key takeaways from a recent trip to China by the firm's head of global and macro asset allocation, Henry H. McVey. It was his fourth visit in just over a year. ""A fundamentally overbuilt real estate industry needs to be addressed — and quickly,"" he said in the report, which counts Changchun Hua, KKR's chief economist for Greater China, among the co-authors. ""Second, confidence must be restored to drive savings back down,"" McVey said, noting that would spur consumers and businesses to spend on upgrading to higher quality products, as Chinese authorities have promoted. Real estate and related sectors once accounted for about one fifth or more of China's economy, depending on the breadth of analysts' calculations. The property industry has slumped in the last few years after Beijing's crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Based on comparisons to housing corrections in the U.S., Japan and Spain, China's ""housing market correction may be just halfway complete"" in terms of its depth, the KKR report said. ""Both price and volume must come under pressure to finish the cleansing cycle,"" the report said. ""To date, though, it has largely been a contraction in volume."" While KKR's report didn't provide much detail on expectations for specific real estate policy, the authors said more action by Beijing to improve China's real estate sector ""could materially shift investor perception."" Amid geopolitical tensions, the country's property market slump and ""According to some of our proprietary survey work, many allocators have considered reducing China exposure to 5-6%, down from 10-12% today at a time that we think fundamentals in the economy are likely bottoming,"" the KKR report said. Much of official Chinese data to start the year beat analysts' expectations. Chinese officials have said the real estate sector remains in a period of adjustment, while Beijing shifts its emphasis Authorities have also released policies to promote financial support for select property developers, while many local governments — though not necessarily the largest cities — have significantly relaxed home purchase restrictions. KKR expects a modest slowdown in China's GDP growth to 4.7% this year, and 4.5% next year, with real estate and Covid-related factors halving their drag on the economy from 1.4 percentage points in 2024 to a 0.7 percentage point drag in 2025. ""Our bottom line is that: with the ongoing [property] correction as well as some potential further policy support, we think the drag to [the] overall economy should moderate a bit over the next few years,"" McVey said in a separate statement. He is also chief investment officer of KKR Balance Sheet. Catering, accommodation and wholesale are set to modestly increase their contribution to growth in the next two years, while digitalization and the shift toward more carbon-neutral, green industry are expected to remain the largest drivers of growth, according to the report. For investors, the report said a more important development than China's GDP increase would be whether authorities could make it easier for businesses and households to tap capital markets. ""Repairing soft spots in [the] economy, especially around housing, will ultimately improve the cost of capital, and will also allow new consumer companies to access the capital markets likely at better prices if real estate and confidence are doing better,"" McVey said in the statement.

"Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Tuesday she still expects interest rate cuts this year, but ruled out the next policy meeting in May. Mester also indicated that the long-run path is higher than policymakers had previously thought. Her fellow policymaker, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, also said Tuesday she expects cuts this year but not until there's more convincing evidence that inflation has been subdued. The central bank official noted progress made on inflation while the economy has continued to grow. Should that continue, rate cuts are likely, though she didn't offer any guidance on timing or extent. ""I continue to think that the most likely scenario is that inflation will continue on its downward trajectory to 2 percent over time. But I need to see more data to raise my confidence,"" Mester said in prepared remarks for a speech in Cleveland. Additional inflation readings will provide clues as to whether some higher-than-expected data points this year either were temporary blips or a sign that the progress on inflation ""is stalling out,"" she added. ""I do not expect I will have enough information by the time of the FOMC's next meeting to make that determination,"" Mester said. Those remarks come nearly two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to Mester's comments would seem to rule out a cut at the April 30-May 1 FOMC meeting, a sentiment also reflected in market pricing. Mester is a voting member of the FOMC but will leave in June after having served the 10-year limit. Futures traders expect the Fed to start easing in June and to cut by three-quarters of a percentage point by the end of the year. San Francisco Fed President Daly said that three reductions this year is a ""very reasonable baseline"" though she said nothing is guaranteed. Daly also is an FOMC voter this year. ""Three rate cuts is a projection, and a projection is not a promise,"" she said, later adding, ""We're getting there, but it's not going to be tomorrow, but it's not going to be forever."" While looking for rate cuts, Mester said she thinks the long-run federal funds rate will be higher than the long-standing expectation of 2.5%. The rate is considered the level where policy is neither restrictive nor stimulative. After the March meeting, the long-rate rate projection moved up to 2.6%, indicating there are other members leaning higher. Mester noted the rate was very low when the Covid pandemic hit and gave the Fed little wiggle room to boost the economy. ""At this point, we are seeking to calibrate our policy well to economic developments so we can avoid having to act in an aggressive fashion,"" she said.

"At least half of adults in a range of major economies report being stressed about their personal finances, and say inflation is one of the main reasons. A significant number also say they feel worse-off financially than their parents, and are pessimistic about their children's financial futures, the In the U.S., Australia, Spain and Mexico, around 70% of adults said they were ""very or somewhat stressed"" about money. The percentage reduced slightly to 63% in the U.K., 57% in Germany, 55% in Switzerland, and roughly half of people in Singapore and France. Across those countries, between a half and two thirds of people said they considered themselves to be part of the middle class — except in the U.K., where it was a lower 37%. Yet despite the middle classes traditionally being considered financially comfortable, between 45% and 62% of those who put themselves in that group described themselves as ""living paycheck to paycheck."" Half of adults in Australia, Germany and the U.K. said they were worse off than they were five years ago. Meanwhile, of the countries surveyed, only adults in Singapore and Mexico were more likely than not to say they were better-off financially than their parents. Inflation was widely cited as the source of financial stress, along with a lack of savings, economic instability and rising interest rates. The study of 4,342 adults was carried out in March and released on Wednesday, ""The health of the global economy, though muted in some areas, is not being reflected in the perceptions of the average person ...

"Decades of trade deficits and a strong dollar created too many ""losers"" in the U.S. economy who turned to Donald Trump's protectionist policies, according to Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute — and those conditions remain. Trump's ""America First"" economic policies led his administration to institute a slew of trade tariffs on China, Mexico, the European Union and others, including slapping 25% duties on imported steel and aluminum. As the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, Trump has proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a minimum levy of 60% on imported Chinese products. These policies have drawn widespread criticism from economists, who argue that tariffs are counterproductive, as they make imported goods more expensive for the average American. Speaking to CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Forum on Friday, Koo said protectionism was a ""horrible thing,"" but that Trump's approach ""does have some economic logic."" ""When we studied economics and free trade, in particular, we were taught...that free trade always creates both winners and losers in the same economy, but the gain that winners get is always greater than the loss of the losers, so the society as a whole always gains. So that's why the free trade is good,"" he noted. Koo nevertheless argued that this rests on the assumption that trade flows are balanced or in surplus, while the U.S. has been running huge deficits for the last forty years, which have expanded the number of ""losers."" ""By 2016, the number of people who consider themselves losers of free trade, were large enough to elect Trump president, and so we have to really go back and say to ourselves: what did we do wrong to allow this many people in United States to view themselves as losers of free trade?"" he said. For Koo, the key problem was the exchange rate, as the strength of the U.S. dollar incentivized foreign imports and hurt U.S. companies exporting around the world. ""We kind of let the exchange rate be decided by so-called market forces, speculators, my clients, Wall Street types, but the foreign exchange rate has to be set in a way that the number of losers does not grow to a point where the free trade itself is lost,"" Koo said. He pointed to a similar pivotal moment in 1985, when President Ronald Reagan faced the same issue of a strong dollar and rising protectionism. At the time, Reagan responded by facilitating the Plaza Accord with France, West Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom to depreciate the U.S. dollar against the respective currencies of these countries through intervention in the foreign exchange market. ""That's the kind of thing we should have been more conscious of doing. Instead of allowing [the] dollar to go wherever the market takes [it], and then these people who are not as fortunate as we are in the financial markets, end up suffering and end up voting for Mr. Trump,"" Koo added. He argued that economists need to move beyond the idea that the trade deficit is simply down to ""too much investment"" and ""too few savings"" in the U.S., as this means deficit can only be reduced by remaining in recession until domestic demand weakens so much that U.S. companies can export more goods, which would not be possible in a democracy. Koo again pointed to past dealings with Japan, suggesting that if the argument held that overseas companies are just filling in where U.S. companies cannot satisfy domestic demand, then the American companies fighting Japanese firms in the 1970s and 70s should have recorded huge profits due to excess demand. ""But that did not actually happen. It's the opposite that happened. So many of them went bankrupt, so many losers of free trade were left in the streets, because it was not savings and investment issue, it was the exchange rate issue,"" he said. ""The dollar should have been much weaker, and Reagan understood that that's why he took that action."" President Joe Biden's administration has also broken from Washington's decades-long spotlight on free trade deals and has retained any of the measures enacted under the Trump administration. However, rather than focus on imposing new tariffs, Biden has instead ",,,,"Free trade flaws fueled Trump's rise in 2016 — and the problems remain, top economist says"

Another measure that also excludes trade services rose 0.4%, compared with the 0.6% gain in January, and was above the estimate for a 0.2% advance. On a year-over-year basis, the headline index increased 1.6%, the biggest move since September 2023. The data contributed to a decline on Wall Street, with the major U.S. stock falling slightly. Treasury yields climbed on the back of the report. A busy morning for economic data also showed that retail sales rebounded, up 0.6% on the month, according to Commerce Department data that is adjusted seasonally but not for inflation.

Also, The market focused on the PPI release, which comes two days after the consumer price index, which measures what consumers pay in the marketplace, The PPI is considered a leading indicator for inflation as it indicates costs early in the supply chain. The BLS reported that about two-thirds of the rise in the headline PPI came from a 1.2% surge in goods prices, the biggest increase since August 2023. As with the CPI, the acceleration was traced to energy prices, with saw a 4.4% increase in the final demand measure. Gasoline prices jumped 6.8% at the wholesale level. Services costs increased 0.3%, boosted by a 3.8% surge in traveler accommodation services. On the retail sales side, the data indicated that consumers kept ahead of CPI inflation, which increased 0.4% on the month, though sales were still sluggish.

"The European Central Bank must take its time to get interest rate cuts right and will have a clearer picture of inflationary pressures in June, the institution's chief economist told CNBC. ""A lot of evidence is accumulating, but what's also fair to say is that the transition from this holding phase, we've been on hold since last September since a substantial hiking cycle, we do have to take our time to get that right, from holding to dialing back restrictions,"" Philip Lane told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Thursday. Lane, a Governing Council member, said the euro zone central bank's Inflation In line with the ECB's March messaging, Lane said that more data was required, particularly around wages, and that the Governing Council would ""learn a lot by April, a lot more by June"" — the dates of its next two meetings. In a news conference after the March meeting, ECB President Christine Lagarde said market pricing on the timing of rate cuts — which indicate a start in June as of Thursday — ""seems to be converging better"" with the central bank's view. June emerged as a key date in market commentary, as it's set to mark the first meeting where the ECB can assess spring data on wage negotiations for the year. Asked about other colleagues on the ECB's Governing Council who have suggested rate cuts could take place before the summer, Lane said he believed this was a reference to the second quarter, which would include June. ""I think Q2 is a time when we will be far enough into 2024 to see more of the wage dynamic, to see more of the price pressures."" He stressed that it was important, in his own role, to ""avoid trying to provide calendar guidance to the market."" ""Once we are sufficiently confident that we will get back to target in a sustainable manner, in a timely manner, that's the right time to move to the next phase,"" he said. Policymakers have repeatedly stressed that many of the causes of the inflationary cycle have subsided, such as the energy price spike and supply chain issues. But they remain concerned about domestic inflationary pressures from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey Lane said Thursday that, while the ECB's forecast relied on some moderation in wage growth, it was ""important"" for people's inflation-adjusted salaries to improve, and that companies should shoulder lower profits to allow this to happen. ""Wages were not the source of this inflation problem. But in terms of making sure we get back to target, the interplay between wages and profits, our forecast is built on a degree of wage deceleration,"" he said. ""It's important to say, we need to see workers' real incomes improve, to rebuild, not just this year, [but] the year after. So we allow for higher to normal wage increases."" Lane added, ""But we also need to see, essentially, firms absorbing a fair amount of that in lower profits. Profits were quite high in 2022, there is some room for profits to come down. And that is part of the open questions we have."" ",,,,"European Central Bank chief economist: Must 'take our time' on rate cuts, clearer picture due in June"
"Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday that it's possible interest rates may have to move higher to control inflation, rather than the cuts her fellow officials have indicated are likely and that the market is expecting. Noting a number of potential upside risks to inflation, Bowman said policymakers need to be careful not to ease policy too quickly. ""While it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,"" she said in prepared remarks for a speech to a group of Fed watchers in New York. ""Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run."" As a member of the Board of Governors, Bowman is a permanent voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Since taking office in late 2018, her public speeches have put her on the more hawkish side of the FOMC, meaning she favors a more aggressive posture toward containing inflation. Bowman said her most likely outcome remains that ""it will eventually become appropriate to lower"" rates, though she noted that ""we are still not yet at the point"" of cutting as ""I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation."" The speech, to the Shadow Open Market Committee, comes with markets on edge about the near-term future of Fed policy. Statements this week from multiple officials, Futures traders are pricing in three cuts this year, though it has become a close call between June and July for when they start. FOMC members in March also penciled in three cuts this year, though one unidentified official in the ""dot plot"" indicated no decreases until 2026 and there was considerable dispersion otherwise about how aggressively the central bank would move. ""Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy,"" Bowman said. Weighing inflation risks, she said that supply-side improvements that helped bring numbers down this year may not have the same impact going forward. Moreover, she cited geopolitical risks and fiscal stimulus as other upside hazards, along with stubbornly higher housing prices and labor market tightness. ""Inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services,"" Bowman said.

The bad news began Monday when Those reports will provide a lot for the Fed to think about when it convenes Tuesday for a two-day policy meeting where it will decide on the current level of interest rates and offer an updated look on where it sees things heading longer term. ""If the data keep rolling in like this, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify a pre-emptive rate cut,"" wrote Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. Taken together, the numbers show ""the great disinflation has stalled and looks to be reversing."" The latest jolt on inflation came Thursday when the Labor Department reported that the Earlier in the week, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said the While surging energy prices contributed substantially to the increase in both inflation figures, there also was evidence of broader pressures from items such as airline fares, used vehicles and beef. In fact, at a time when the focus has shifted to services inflation, goods prices leaped 1.2% in the PPI reading, the biggest increase since August 2023. ""There continue to be signs in PPI data that the disinflation in goods prices is largely coming to an end,"" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark wrote after the report's release. Taken together, the stubbornly high prices appear to have taken their toll on both consumer expectations and behavior. While substantially lower than its mid-2022 peak, inflation has proved resilient despite the Fed's 11 rate hikes totaling 5.25 percentage points and its moves to cut its bond holdings by nearly $1.4 trillion. The New York Fed survey showed that three- and five-year inflation expectations respectively moved up to 2.7% and 2.9%. While such surveys often can be especially sensitive to gas prices, this one showed energy expectations relatively constant and reflected doubt from consumers that the Fed will achieve its 2% mandate anytime soon. On a policy level, that could mean the Fed Along with the surprisingly strong inflation data, consumers are showing signs of letting up on their massive shopping spree over the past few years. Over the past year, sales increased 1.5%, or 1.7 percentage points below the headline inflation rate and 2.3 points below the core rate that excludes food and energy. Investors will get a look at how policymakers feel when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee convenes next week. The FOMC will release both its rate decision — there's virtually no chance of a change in either direction — as well as its revised outlook for longer-term rates, gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment.

"BEIJING — Chinese electric car company Since November, Nio has partnered with at least four Chinese automakers — Changan, Geely, Chery and JAC — for developing battery swap standards and expanding the network in China. All these efforts are aimed at alleviating consumers' anxiety about driving range. While having a large network of battery charging stations helps address those concerns, battery swapping is a faster method as it takes only a few minutes. ""Swapping right now is mainly driven by Nio. Of course, Nio found out this is an ecosystem,"" CLSA's deputy head of research Ding Luo said in an interview. ""If only one player is trying to build up the whole ecosystem, it's impossible for [them]. That's why they're thinking whether they can invite some partners."" Battery swapping still isn't mainstream because the car batteries need to be standardized, he added. While a charging station resembles a typical gas station, battery-swap technology is housed in a shed-like structure. It uses machines to automatically exchange depleted batteries for pre-charged ones in compatible cars. Nio said in mid-March that it completed 40 million battery swaps compared with nearly 37 million charges at its public stations — Nio consumers can also access third-party charging stations, or install one at home. ""I think our outlook is very simple,"" Shen Fei, senior vice president of Nio's power division, said in Chinese translated by CNBC. ""The first thing is to serve Nio's users, and then provide a good battery charging and swapping experience, make charging more convenient than refueling, and at the same time help the company sell more cars."" The company claims that with battery swap, drivers can get a fresh charge in three minutes, if they opt in for a Shen said more car models will be added to Nio's battery swap network, while adding that swapping can allow drivers to keep abreast with improvements in battery technology. Power services and other products account for just about 10% of Nio's total revenue. The company said that category of ""other sales"" for 2023 grew by 69% to 6.36 billion yuan ($895.9 million). Nio does not break out swap station revenue. Battery swapping has been tried by the industry with mixed success, especially in the U.S. Tesla and a startup called Better Space tried out swapping more than 10 years ago, but the venture soon closed. In 2021, another startup, While it's not clear how much headway Ample has made in the U.S., the company has since expanded its partnerships overseas. Last month the company announced it would serve ""For swapping to work it can't be niche,"" Tu Le, head of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said. ""Battery inventory investment is massive, so it needs to be amortized over lots of swapping."" But he was cautious on whether Nio could sell enough of its own premium-priced cars to make the economics work. ""For now I still think the combination of swapping and charging makes for a pretty attractive feature set, but swapping alone likely doesn't help them sell that many more cars."" ""I think the nudge the Chinese government gave to encourage others to join forces with Nio on swapping could create the necessary pool of vehicles to make swapping viable,"" he added. Nio is the first major electric car company to roll out battery swap stations in addition to charging stations, alongside its own vehicles in mainland China and The company has installed more than 2,300 battery swap stations, and plans to install 1,000 more this year. Nio's investment in battery swap stations is about two years ahead of market demand, CEO William Li said last month, adding that less than a fifth of battery swap stations that Nio operates are processing 60 orders a day, likely the minimum orders needed for a station to break even. Nio's battery charging stations, on the other hand, reached profitability last year, according to the company. It plans to build 20,000 more this year. Passenger car battery swap stations can cost around $500,000 to build, while a relatively basic charging station with two ports costs around $200,000 to $300,000, according to Shay Natarajan, a North America-based partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund that invests in transportation. CLSA's Luo said businesses also prefer to invest in normal charging stations than swap stations because they make a higher return. But if businesses want to install faster-charging stations, he said they might face power grid challenges. CLSA's analysis found that the power required for five superchargers in one location would be more than what 300 families would normally consume. Tesla is also collaborating with automakers in battery charging, with its over 50,000 superchargers worldwide that claim to restore about two-thirds of a battery's charge in 15 minutes. In February, Ford reached a deal that allows its electric cars to The rapid development of electric cars, ostensibly aimed at reducing carbon emissions, also raises questions about battery waste. Nio pointed out that recent growth of new energy vehicles, which include hybrids, means nearly 20 million batteries will be reaching the end of their eight-year warranty period between 2025 and 2032. Last month, the company announced a partnership with battery giant Nio claimed that by using battery swap and big data, it can retain 80% of a battery's capacity after 12 years of use. Nio also said last month that CATL will develop batteries with longer lives for the company. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Michael Wayland contributed to this report.

Here's a look into the driving forces behind egg freezing and the financial, social and emotional costs that come with it — based on personal experiences from women across the country. There's a notion that most women delaying motherhood are doing so to focus on other aspects of their lives, such as their careers.

This problem stems from the fact that today, women are receiving higher education at greater rates than men. Inhorn noted that women are outperforming men in higher education in 60% of countries, and that in the United States alone there are 27% more women than men in higher education. ""The result is that, for women who are highly educated in America and of reproductive age — between 20 and 39 — there literally are millions too few college-educated men,"" Inhorn added. Another reason women freeze their eggs is the sense of empowerment the procedure brings them. Fundamentally, Inhorn believes that this freedom that egg freezing allows is what ultimately draws increasingly younger women to the procedure. ""It gives you a little reprieve, a little extra time,"" she said. This statement is one that reproductive endocrinologists and fertility specialists Drs. Nicole Noyes and Aimee Eyvazzadeh agree with. Noyes, who has worked in the fertility industry since 2004 and is based in New York, has seen a noticeable shift in her patients' ages and attitudes in the last two decades. In the beginning, her patients tended to be older, in their early 40s and viewed egg freezing as a last-ditch procedure as they hedged the end of their reproductive lives. Now, women as young as their late 20s come in to see Noyes. Eyvazzadeh, who has also worked in the field for 20 years and lives in California, has noticed a trend towards younger patients who are choosing to freeze their eggs while they're at their most viable. This is the case for social media influencer Serena Kerrigan, who just recently turned 30. Despite being in a relationship, egg freezing was a procedure she willingly undertook while focusing on growing her business, she told CNBC. Kerrigan, who has more than 800,000 followers between her Instagram and TikTok and is based in New York, began sharing her egg freezing journey last year. She wanted to remove some of the stigma around egg freezing and give her followers an inside look at the arduous process. Kerrigan has paid for all her procedures on her own, she told CNBC, and recently partnered with her clinic, Spring Fertility, to donate a round of egg freezing to one of her followers. Eventually, she hopes egg freezing can be less stigmatized. ""There's a layer of shame or taboo that I actually don't understand. To me, this is science, and this is incredible, and this is a huge advancement,"" she said. ""This is a way of putting the power back into women and having control of their lives."" While the benefits of egg freezing are certainly enormous, so too are the associated costs. The average price for a single egg freezing cycle in the U.S. clocks in at Nutrition health coach Jenny Hayes Edwards froze her eggs in 2010 at 34 years old and was But high costs were her number one obstacle. Her restaurants had taken a hit after the 2008 financial collapse, when many consumers began foregoing their expensive ski vacations in Colorado. Hayes Edwards remembers it being a tough decision to make. But her mother eventually helped sway her in favor of the procedure. ""It's just money, and the opportunity that you might be missing is so much bigger,"" Hayes Edwards recalled her mother saying. ""I was so grateful that she pushed me over the edge."" She was able to scrape together the $15,000 needed through maxing out a credit card, selling some jewelry and liquidating a bond in her inheritance. Hayes Edwards now has a healthy three-year-old daughter, conceived nearly a decade after she froze her eggs, and is still appreciative for the extra time egg freezing bought her to meet her now-husband. In recent years, egg freezing, fertility and family planning services have increasingly Michelle Parsons decided to freeze her eggs since the procedure was offered through her job. The various tech companies Parsons has worked for have offered anywhere between $10,000 to $75,000 in fertility benefits. Parsons, who is a lesbian, had always known that she wanted to freeze her eggs — and undertook the procedure while working at Match Group as chief product officer of dating app Hinge. At the time, neither she nor her ex-partner were ready to have children, but it was one financial incentive Parsons didn't want to miss out on. Besides eggs, Parsons also chose to freeze her successfully fertilized embryos as another backup. Frozen embryos have a much higher likelihood of viable thawing. In fact, Parsons' search for a sperm donor sparked one of the most-used features on the Hinge app — voice prompts. ""When we started to listen to all of these voice recordings of potential sperm donors, the lightbulb went off in my head and I was like, wow, this is what's missing from dating right now,"" Parsons told CNBC. ""Because voice gives you so much nuance into personality, humor, vibe … we ended up building that feature called voice prompts on Hinge and it was a huge, wild success that led to rapid growth for Hinge and it became viral on TikTok."" Still, Parsons noticed egg freezing taking a toll on her professional and personal life in other ways. ""You have to inject yourself with hormones for two weeks. You have to eat differently. You don't really want to be in social settings. You can't drink. There are all these other ramifications around just going through that process, even though we know it'll be for this one month and then it'll be over,"" she said. The process also doesn't guarantee success. Evelyn Gosnell underwent her first egg retrieval when she was 32, following by two additional cycles at 36 and 38 years old. By the time she was ready to have children with her now-partner, the New York-based behavioral scientist had many frozen eggs ready. But, she received no viable and normal embryos after her eggs had been thawed and fertilized.

"European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde on Wednesday reiterated that policymakers will consider bringing interest rates down in June, but sketched an uncertain path beyond that. ""By June we will have a new set of projections that will confirm whether the inflation path we foresaw in our March forecast remains valid,"" Lagarde said in a speech in Frankfurt. The June meeting has been flagged as a potential turning point by many members of the ECB's Governing Council — which votes on rate moves — as it will be the first gathering for which data from spring wage negotiations will be available. The ECB is on alert for Data available by June will also provide more insight into the path of underlying inflation and the direction of the labor market, according to Lagarde. ""If these data reveal a sufficient degree of alignment between the path of underlying inflation and our projections, and assuming transmission remains strong, we will be able to move into the dialling back phase of our policy cycle and make policy less restrictive,"" she said. ""But thereafter, domestic price pressures will still be visible. We expect services inflation, for example, to remain elevated for most of this year. So, there will be a period ahead where we need to confirm on an ongoing basis that the incoming data supports our inflation outlook."" Lagarde's message overall was highly positive on the path on inflation, despite flagging geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing domestic price pressures. ""Unlike in the earlier phases of our policy cycle, there are reasons to believe that the expected disinflationary path will continue,"" Lagarde said, stressing confidence in the latest set of The euro zone's central bank has held rates steady since Market attention is now moving to how many rate cuts the ECB is likely to carry out over the course of this year.

"Inflation rose in line with expectations in February, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on hold before it can start considering interest rate cuts, according to a measure the central bank considers its more important barometer. The Including volatile food and energy costs, the headline PCE reading showed a 0.3% increase for the month and 2.5% at the 12-month rate, compared to estimates for 0.4% and 2.5%.

While the Fed looks at both measures when making policy, it considers core to be a better gauge of long-term inflation pressures. The Fed targets 2% annual inflation; core PCE inflation hasn't been below that level in three years. ""Nothing really super surprising. Obviously not the numbers the Fed wants to see, but I don't think this is going to catch anybody off guard when they come back to work on Monday,"" Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, told CNBC. ""I think everybody is going to pivot to labor pretty quickly and say well maybe if we see some weakness and cracks over here, this little stickiness in inflation and PCE isn't going to matter as much."" Rising energy costs helped push up the headline reading, with a 2.3% increase. The food index edged up 0.1%. Inflation pressures came more from the goods side, which rose 0.5%, compared to the 0.3% increase for services. That countered the trend over the past year, during which services rose 3.8% while goods actually fell by 0.2%. Other upward pressure came from international travel services, air transportation, and financial services and insurance. On the goods side, the motor vehicles and parts category was the biggest contributor. Along with the inflation increase, consumer spending shot up 0.8% on the month, well ahead of the 0.5% estimate, possibly indicating additional inflation pressures. Personal income increased 0.3%, slightly softer than the 0.4% estimate. The release comes a little more than a week after the central bank again held its benchmark short-term borrowing rate steady and indicated it still has not seen enough progress on inflation to consider cutting. In their quarterly update of rate projections, members of the Federal Open Market Committee again pointed to three quarter-percentage point cuts this year and in 2025.

"Falling fertility rates are set to spark a transformational demographic shift over the next 25 years, with major implications for the global economy, according to a new study. By 2050, three-quarters of countries are forecast to fall below the population replacement birth rate of 2.1 babies per female, research That would leave 49 countries — primarily in low-income regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia — responsible for the majority of new births. ""Future trends in fertility rates and livebirths will propagate shifts in global population dynamics, driving changes to international relations and a geopolitical environment, and highlighting new challenges in migration and global aid networks,"" the report's authors wrote in their conclusion. By 2100, just six countries are expected to have population-replacing birth rates: The African nations of Chad, Niger and Tonga, the Pacific islands of Samoa and Tonga, and central Asia's Tajikistan. That shifting demographic landscape will have ""profound"" social, economic, environmental and geopolitical impacts, the report's authors said. In particular, shrinking workforces in advanced economies will require significant political and fiscal intervention, even as advances in technology provide some support. ""As the workforce declines, the total size of the economy will tend to decline even if output per worker stays the same. In the absence of liberal migration policies, these nations will face many challenges,"" Dr. Christopher Murray, a lead author of the report and director at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNBC. ""AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics may diminish the economic impact of declining workforces but some sectors such as housing would continue to be strongly affected,"" he added. The report, which was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, did not put a figure on the specific economic impact of the demographic shifts. However, it did highlight a divergence between high-income countries, where birth rates are steadily falling, and low-income countries, where they continue to rise. From 1950 to 2021, the global total fertility rate (TFR) — or average number of babies born to a woman — more than halved, falling from 4.84 to 2.23, as many countries grew wealthier and women had fewer babies. That trend was exacerbated by societal shifts, such as an increase in female workforce participation, and political measures including China's one-child policy. From 2050 to 2100, the total global fertility rate is set to fall further from 1.83 to 1.59. The replacement rate — or number of children a couple would need to have to replace themselves — That comes even as the global population is forecast to grow from 8 billion currently to 9.7 billion by 2050, before peaking at around 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s, Already, many advanced economies have fertility rates well below the replacement rate. By the middle of the century, that category is set to include major economies China and India, with South Korea's birth rate ranking as the lowest globally at 0.82 Meantime, lower-income countries are expected to see their share of new births almost double from 18% in 2021 to 35% by 2100. By the turn of the century, sub-Saharan Africa will account for half of all new births, according to the report. Murray said that this could put poorer countries in a ""stronger position"" to negotiate more ethical and fair migration policies — leverage that could become important as countries grow increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change.

"The Swiss National Bank on Thursday surprised the market with a decision to lower its main policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5%, saying national inflation is likely to stay below 2% for the foreseeable future. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the Swiss central bank to hold rates at 1.75%. ""For some months now, inflation has been back below 2% and thus in the range the SNB equates with price stability. According to the new forecast, inflation is also likely to remain in this range over the next few years,"" the bank said. Swiss inflation continued to fall in February, hitting 1.2%. The SNB also reduced its annual inflation forecasts. The bank now sees average inflation reaching 1.4% in 2024, down from its 1.9% estimate in December, and 1.2% for 2025, trimmed from the previous 1.6% estimate. Its first forecast for 2026 puts average inflation at 1.1% over the period. Following the announcement, analysts at Capital Economics said they expect two more SNB rate cuts over the course of this year, ""with the Bank sounding more dovish and inflation likely to undershoot its forecasts."" ""We think inflation will come in even lower than the new SNB forecasts imply and remain around the current level of 1.2% before falling to below 1.0% next year. Accordingly, we forecast the SNB to cut rates at the September and December meetings taking the policy rate to 1%, where we think it will remain throughout 2025 and 2026,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note. The September meeting is likely to be the last under the stewardship of SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan, who will step down at the end of that month after 12 years at the helm. The SNB said Swiss economic growth is ""likely to remain modest in the coming quarters,"" with the GDP poised to expand by roughly 1% this year. ""Our forecast for Switzerland, as for the global economy, is subject to significant uncertainty. The main risk is weaker economic activity abroad. Momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets has weakened noticeably in recent quarters,"" the SNB said. ""However, the vulnerabilities in these markets remain."" On a macro level, the SNB flagged ""moderate"" global economic growth in the coming quarters, along with likely falls in inflation partly thanks to restrictive monetary policy strategies. It nevertheless acknowledged ""significant risks"" and geopolitical tensions that could cloud the international economic horizon. In a TV interview with CNBC's Silvia Amaro, Jordan said that the improved inflation forecast has given the bank the breathing room to lower rates, but refused to be drawn on the inevitability of three cuts this year. ""We will see in June whether the situation is different, whether inflationary pressure continues to decline, then we'll make a new decision in June,"" he said, acknowledging that the bank remains ready to intercede in the foreign exchange market ""if necessary"" to defend the Swiss franc. High interest rates typically prop up currencies and weaken the relative value of other coins against them. ""We said very clearly that we remain ... available to intervene in the foreign exchange market, if necessary. So we can use this instrument in order to make sure that monetary conditions remain appropriate,"" Jordan noted. He fell short of commenting on whether other central banks will take a page from the SNB's trailblazing book and loosen their monetary policy, but signaled no concerns over the potential impact their moves may have on the Swiss currency. ""We will profit from a situation where we have price stability globally. Of course, it could have an impact on interest rate differentials, but I think a situation where the price stability is re-established everywhere, this is something that is positive for the global economy, and so also for Switzerland,"" he said. Switzerland is the first advanced economy to cut interest rates following a prolonged period of high inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on global trade and Russia's war in Ukraine. Switzerland was also affected by jitters in the banking space last year, when the government stepped in to facilitate Jordan on Thursday stressed to CNBC the importance of liquidity to the Swiss banking sector. ""A key message from us is always that they have to prepare their collateral, so that this collateral ... in case they need additional liquidity,"" he said. Asked whether Swiss lenders are doing enough in this direction, Jordan said there were ""very good discussions in Switzerland at the moment"" between banks and the SNB. ""The situation of March last year and also in the United States made it very clear also to smaller banks that liquidity issues could be a problem,"" he said. ""I think we are on the good way in order to make sure that sufficient collateral will be available in an emergency case ... but it's very important that we continue to go in that direction."" The Swiss National Bank's rate announcement emerged just before Norway's central bank refused to blink, ""The rate path we're presenting today indicates... an autumn rate cut, most likely in September,"" Norges Bank Governor Ida Wolden Bache told a press conference on Thursday, according to Reuters.

"Stubbornly high inflation could push the Federal Reserve into a more cautious stance this year regarding interest rate cuts, the central bank's former vice chair said Friday. Richard Clarida, who served as Fed governor until January 2022 and is now a global economic advisor at asset management giant Pimco, said his former colleagues need to be on guard against sticky prices that could thwart plans to ease monetary policy this year. At its meeting earlier this week, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee indicated ""This may be more of a hope than a forecast,"" Clarida said during an interview on CNBC's "" Markets also are expecting three cuts this year, though that pricing has been scaled back after data to start the year showed inflation higher than expected. Fed officials are banking that elevated shelter inflation is on its way down, paving the way to lower their key borrowing rate from its highest level in more than 23 years. Clarida, however, said the extent to which the Fed can cut is unclear. ""Under a pretty broad range of scenarios, they're going to get at least one cut in this year,"" he said. However, the calculus gets different as inflation data provides mixed signals. The Fed prefers the Commerce Department's measure of personal consumption expenditures prices, with a particular focus on the core reading that excludes food and energy.

A ""What I think is going on here is a delicate balance that [Powell is] trying to navigate,"" Clarida said.

While the March inflation count represents ""the smallest monthly increase in three months and suggests that the impact of the large minimum wage hike in January may now have largely passed, it is still far from consistent with the single-digit inflation that policymakers are trying to achieve,"" Nicholas Farr, an emerging Europe economist at London-based Capital Economics, wrote in an analyst note Wednesday. ""The latest inflation figures do little to change our view that further monetary tightening lies in store and that a more concerted effort to tighten fiscal policy will be needed too,"" he said. Turkey's central bank implemented eight consecutive interest rate hikes from June 2023 to January 2024, totaling a cumulative 3,650 basis points. It paused in February, suggesting the tightening cycle was over, before raising rates again in March, citing ""deterioration in the inflation outlook"" and saying that ""tight monetary stance will be maintained until a significant and sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed."" Analysts note that with Economic pain and steep living cost increases for ordinary Turks over the last several years played a major role in the results, political observers said. Exercising tight control over the central bank, Erdogan for the last few years refused to raise rates, calling them ""the mother of all evil"" and insisting, against economic orthodoxy, that lowering rates was the way to cool inflation. This was despite declining foreign currency reserves and a rapidly weakening Only after appointing a new finance and central bank team in May 2023 did the central bank stage a turnaround in policy, suggesting greater independence at the bank from the executive branch of Turkey's government.

In addition to the strong employment pickup, ADP reported that wages for workers who stayed in their jobs increased 5.1% from a year ago, the same rate as February after showing a steady easing going well back into 2023. Those switching jobs saw gains of 10%, also higher than in previous months. ""March was surprising not just for the pay gains, but the sectors that recorded them,"" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. ""Inflation has been cooling, but our data shows pay is heating up in both goods and services."" Job gains were fairly broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality with 63,000. Other sectors showing significant increases included construction (33,000), trade, transportation and utilities (29,000), and education and health services (17,000). Professional and business services saw a loss of 8,000. Services-related industries accounted for 142,000 of the total, with goods providing the rest. ADP, whose survey is based on payroll data analysis of more than 25 million workers, does not track government jobs. Most of the growth came from companies that employ more than 50 workers, with small businesses adding just 16,000 to the total.

Government and leisure and hospitality were the next two strongest sectors, and together these top groups accounted for more than 60% of March's gains. Within health care, ambulatory services and hospitals combined to add 55,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Local government was another strong subgroup for hiring, growing by 49,000 jobs. Notably, the leisure and hospitality sector is now back to its pre-pandemic employment level, according to the BLS. Employment in this area, which includes bars and restaurants, fell dramatically in 2020 when many such establishments were closed for health concerns. The continued rebound of these jobs, along with strong months for sectors like construction, could be a sign that immigration is helping the labor market grow without putting too much upward pressure on wages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the labor force participation has changed little in the past year despite consistent upside surprises for job gains. ""Last year, half of the growth in the labor force came from net immigration. There were 5.2 million additional jobs last year, thanks to net immigration.

The core rate of inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, cooled from 3.1% to 2.9%, also coming in below expectations. However, inflation in services — a key watcher for the European Central Bank — remained stuck at 4% for a fifth straight month, pointing to continued pressure from wage growth.

"The U.S. Federal Reserve has become too data dependent and has lost sight of its overall strategy, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said Friday. The economist told CNBC that a longer-term, more strategic outlook could see policymakers settle on a new inflation target of closer to 3%.

However, he noted that policymakers' hawkish approach could be an indication that they are considering the possibility of a new normal inflation target. ""The way you discuss it politely is you don't say 'let's change the inflation target,' you say 'let's get to 2% somewhere in the future. Let's have a trajectory,'"" El-Erian said. ""It may well prove that the economy is stable nearer to 3%. I don't think that's going to de-anchor inflation expectations,"" he added. In an effort to drag inflation back down toward its target, the Fed has hiked interest rates 11 times in total over the last few years to a target range of 5.25%-5.5% — the highest level for more than 22 years. The Fed's goal has proven especially challenging given the high volumes of U.S. banking reserves at present, according to Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. In past monetary tightening cycles, central banks have squeezed bank reserves as an additional means of lowering inflation. But with current U.S. reserves around 1,700 larger than before the 2008 Lehman crisis, according to Koo, that path was unviable.

But in more recent years, U.S. consumers have felt increasing pressure amid runaway inflation, elevated interest rates and the And experts have been surprised by the unwavering propensity of Americans to use their cash, even as To be sure, there are signs of financial stress on consumers that impact monetary decisions around food. Though customers still opt for fries, Werner said Lamb Weston's volume took a hit nonetheless due to softer foot traffic overall in the restaurants it serves.

"Job creation in March easily topped expectations in a sign of continued acceleration for what has been a bustling and resilient labor market. Nonfarm payrolls increased 303,000 for the month, well above the Dow Jones estimate for a rise of 200,000 and higher than the downwardly revised 270,000 gain in February, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%, as expected, even though the labor force participation rate moved higher to 62.7%, a gain of 0.2 percentage point from February. A broader measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons held steady at 7.3%. In the key average hourly earnings measure, wages rose 0.3% for the month and 4.1% from a year ago, both in line with Wall Street estimates. Growth came from many of the usual sectors that have powered gains in recent months. Health care led with 72,000, followed by government (71,000), leisure and hospitality (49,000), and construction (39,000). Retail trade contributed 18,000 while the ""other services"" category added 16,000. The February revision was just 5,000 lower while the January revision brought that total up by 27,000 to 256,000, still well below the ""This is another really strong report,"" said Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments. ""This report and the February report showed some broadening in terms of job creation, which is a very good sign."" Despite the move lower in the broader unemployment level, the rate for Black people surged to 6.4%, a gain of 0.8 percentage point, tying the highest level since August 2022. Rates for Asians and Hispanics both fell sharply to 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively. A string of positive gains has kept unemployment below 4% since January 2022, though there have been some signs of cracks. For instance the level of household employment had grown only modestly over the past year, while temporary employment has declined sharply. However, the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, posted an even more robust gain in March, up 498,000, more than absorbing the 469,000 increase in the civilian labor force level. Gains tilted heavily to part-time workers in the household survey. Full-time workers fell by 6,000, while part-timers increased by 691,000. Multiple job holders rose by 217,000, to 5.2% of the total employment level. Markets have been keeping close watch over the employment data particularly as the Federal Reserve weighs its next moves on monetary policy. Stocks have tumbled this week amid concerns that a strong labor market and resilient economy could keep the central bank on hold for longer than expected. Stock market futures rose following the report while Treasury yields also added to gains. The Fed is looking to guide inflation back down to 2% annually, a goal that has proven elusive even as the rate of price gains has decelerated from its peak in mid-2022. Most measures have inflation running above 3%, though the Fed's preferred gauge is below that level. Market pricing is pointing toward the first interest rate cut coming in June, though several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, this week indicated they prefer to take a cautious data-dependent approach. The BLS on Wednesday is scheduled to release its consumer price index reading for March. Correction: The unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%. An earlier version misstated the move.

"The unemployment rate among Black Americans jumped in March, according to data released Friday Black unemployment rose to 6.4% last month, up from 5.6% in February. That's higher than the overall unemployment rate, which When accounting for gender, the unemployment rate for Black women aged 20 or older spiked to 5.6%, a big increase from the 4.4% rate in February. Black men's jobless rates climbed slightly higher to 6.2% from 6.1%. ""That's a concerning trend,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Gould pointed out that the unemployment rate for Black Americans has been steadily increasing since December. ""I would say it's not alarming yet, but I think it's something that we really need to watch in coming months,"" she added. While March's increase was primarily driven by the surge among Black women, Gould noted that in the past four months, the unemployment rates for both men and women has risen. However, she also cautioned that monthly data for demographic groups can be volatile by nature. Last month, the labor force participation rate – the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work – among Black Americans inched lower to 63.6%, down from 63.7% in February.  For Black women, the rate ticked lower to 63% from 63.4%, while it inched down to 69.6% from 69.8% among Black men. ""People are looking for more opportunities, not all of them are getting them, and that's why the unemployment rate is rising,"" Gould added. This compares to the overall U.S. labor market participation rate, which rose to 62.7% in March from February's 62.5%. Black Americans were the demographic group that suffered the most from Covid-induced business shutdowns.

"The March nonfarm payrolls count likely will indicate hiring continuing at a solid pace, though some weakening foundations of the labor market could take greater focus when the Labor Department releases its key report Friday morning. Job growth is expected to come in at 200,000 for the period, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast. If that's correct, it will mark a slowdown from Yet a funny thing has been happening with the jobs reports recently: Initially strong numbers have tended to be lowered in subsequent estimates, raising questions about whether the jobs situation is as positive as it looks. That will be just one of several key areas in focus when the report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. February's release raised eyebrows with a gain that trounced the Wall Street outlook for 198,000 new jobs. Also gaining notice, though, were revisions to the prior two months that reduced December's count by 43,000 to 290,000 and January's by a whopping 124,000 to 229,000. For all of 2023, The trend ""makes me wonder about the credibility of the first number,"" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas. ""So I'll be looking for the revisions from the prior month to see if they're going to be knocked down, and most likely they will be. That's why if you get a big number, take it with a grain of salt."" There is some anticipation on Wall Street of an upside surprise: Goldman Sachs raised its initial forecast to 240,000, an increase of 25,000, following strong Along with numbers, composition is important, namely where the growth is coming from and whether there are any cracks in the employment armor. The job market's resilience has confounded many economists who spent the past two years searching for a jobs-led recession that never happened. ""Firms are seeing strong demand. They've dramatically increased their productivity, and so they're hiring for different kinds of jobs,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. ""That has enabled them to deal with the high-rate environment."" Still, there are areas of concern. Household employment, which counts individual workers rather than total jobs and is used to calculate the unemployment rate, has fallen by nearly 1 million since November. The survey is more volatile and uses a much smaller sample than the establishment count that yields the headline payrolls growth total. But there's no obvious reason for the weakness, though some economists speculate it could involve the surge in illegal immigration over the past few years. Also, Federal Reserve officials will watch all those factors for signs of inflation pressures. Stocks have been under pressure this week as investors worry about the direction of monetary policy. Average hourly earnings are projected to have increased 0.3% in March, which would be a jump from 0.1% in February, though the estimate for the annual gain is 4.1%, or 0.2 percentage point less. If the consensus calls are correct, it's unlikely to move the needle much for the Fed, which is expected to ""Unless there is a wildly positive or outright tragic employment report, they're going to stay on course,"" North said. ""They've been really clear recently pushing back on the market, saying we're in no big hurry, inflation is not down to 2%."" North said he expects the Fed to wait until July before it starts cutting rates — contrary to current market expectations. ",,,,Job gains expected again in March.

"A paper mill in a small Mississippi town could help demonstrate whether capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing it deep underground is a viable path to fight climate change. The proposed project at Amazon The Vicksburg paper mill project is just one example of how Carbon capture and storage technology today is expensive, logistically complex and faces controversy over its role in the energy transition and safety concerns in communities where pipeline infrastructure would be expanded. The Paris-based International Energy Agency has described carbon capture and storage as ""critical"" to achieve global net-zero emissions, while also warning the oil and gas industry against using the technology as a way to maintain the status quo on fossil fuels. Some climate activists accuse the industry of simply investing in carbon capture as way to extend the use of oil and gas. The technology typically uses chemical absorption to capture carbon dioxide emitted from the chimney of an industrial plant. The emissions are condensed into a fluid for transport, normally through a pipeline, and are stored thousands of feet below ground in depleted oil wells or geological formations such as saltwater reservoirs. The challenges to implementing the technology are immense. The world needs to capture more than 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030, more than 20 times the 45 million metric tons captured in 2022, according to the IEA. By 2050, the amount of carbon that's captured needs to reach 6 billion tons — more than 130 times the 2022 level, according to the agency. But the track record of carbon capture and storage so far has been one of ""underperformance,"" with only 5% of announced projects having reached a final investment decision, according to the IEA. The industry needs to demonstrate that the technology can operate economically at scale after struggling to ramp up deployment for years, the agency says. The Vicksburg papermill project is still in an early development stage. SLB is confident that it will prove technologically viable, said Fred Majkut, senior vice president of carbon solutions at the company. The goal is to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is also economically viable, Majkut said. ""The economic viability of carbon capture and sequestration is a challenge today because the cost of building most plants in order to capture carbon dioxide are very significant,"" the executive said. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit an industrial plant, he said. For International Paper, the Vicksburg project is a potential way to produce lower carbon products for consumers who are climate conscious and a potential opportunity to benefit financially through the sale of carbon credits. ""There are examples in the marketplace where customers have the opportunity to express their preferences economically, whether that's clicking a button to say they want to abate the carbon emissions for a trip in an Uber or an airplane,"" said Adam Miklos, director of low carbon innovation at International Paper. ""Ultimately, it has the potential to reduce our emissions and, if successful, present an opportunity to sell carbon and renewable credits,"" Miklos said. The Mississippi mill is a snapshot of how the oil and gas industry is trying to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is a viable tool in the race to slash emissions, after using similar technology for decades to extract oil. The industry has used carbon storage techniques since the 1970s in a process called enhanced oil recovery, in which carbon dioxide is injected underground to create pressure that pushes more crude toward production wells. Chevron Total spending on carbon capture and storage projects is expected to reach $241 billion worldwide by 2030 if all announced projects materialize, according Rystad Energy. The United States and the United Kingdom are the leaders, with investments expected to reach $85 billion and $45 billion, respectively, by the end of the decade, according to Rystad. In the U.S., investment in carbon management technologies more than doubled to $1.2 billion in 2023, the first full year after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, according to the Cement plants, for example, produce emissions not only by burning fossil fuels, but also due to the materials used in the manufacturing process. About two-thirds of the industry's carbon dioxide emissions come from chemical reactions that occur when breaking down limestone. Cement is one of the most widely-used products globally, second only to drinking water, and is responsible for about 7% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions alone, ""Right now, these types of industries have no way to effectively decarbonize to net zero without carbon capture,"" Majkut said. ""If they want to produce cement, there will be CO2 emissions simply because of the materials that are being used."" With carbon storage already a mature commercial business, SLB is trying to tackle the capture side, which presents one of the major hurdles to scaling up the technology due to its high cost, according to Majkut. The solvent that would be used to catch carbon dioxide molecules at the Mississippi mill promises to lower the energy requirements of the capture process and make it more cost effective, he said. ""We're quite comfortable that in the next 12 to 24 months, we will be coming to market with actually that chemistry as part of our core offering and develop what we call process design packages,"" Majkut said. SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch has said carbon capture and storage will play a leading role in the company's annual revenue targets of $3 billion by 2030 and $10 billion by 2040 for its new energy portfolio. SLB this month announced a nearly $400 million investment in Aker Carbon Capture, a pure-play carbon capture company based in Norway, in an effort to accelerate deployment of the technology at commercial scale. Competitor Baker Hughes is developing direct air capture technology after acquiring a company called Mosaic Materials in 2022. Baker Hughes has not disclosed the value of the deal. The technology aims to catch low concentration carbon dioxide emissions, which are harder to capture, directly from the atmosphere as well as from industrial plants. Baker Hughes anticipates the technology will most likely come to market by the end of 2026. Baker Hughes is targeting up to $7 billion in orders by 2030 for its new energy portfolio, which includes carbon capture and storage technology. The company is forecasting a total market for its new energy business of between $60 billion and $70 billion by the end of the decade. ""By 2030, I do believe we're going to start to see these technologies start to become reasonably competitive,"" said Alessandro Bresciani, senior vice president of climate technologies at Baker Hughes. The Gulf Coast of the United States, home to enormous oil and gas and other industrial plants, is emerging as a center of carbon capture and storage investments in the U.S. Jeff Gustavson, vice president of lower carbon energies at Chevron, said the region has the potential to quickly increase use of the technology because of favorable geology for storage located close to high concentration emissions that are easier to capture at a lower cost. Some 100 million tons of carbon dioxide are emitted annually from Houston through to Port Arthur, Texas, Gustavson said. Chevron Exxon over the past two years has entered agreements to capture carbon emissions from ammonia and fertilizer producer Dan Ammann, president of low carbon solutions at Exxon, said those three contracts combined promise to remove 5 million tons of emissions annually — the equivalent of converting 2 million gas-powered cars to electric vehicles. Exxon completed its acquisition of the carbon-dioxide pipeline operator Denbury for $5 billion in late 2023. The deal gave Exxon more than 900 miles of pipeline stretching through Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that are located near at least 10 storage sites in the region. ""It gives us sort of instantaneous scale, instantaneous reach, across this huge source of emissions along the Gulf Coast,"" Ammann said of the Denbury acquisition. ""It gives us the ability to develop storage all along that pipeline as well."" Exxon says it now owns the largest carbon dioxide pipeline network in the U.S. As the infrastructure comes together, Exxon is seeing ""a very high level of interest from a lot of different emitters along the Gulf Coast,"" Ammann said. Chevron is the operator and lead investor in a flagship project called Bayou Bend, which has a 140,000 acre position of permanent carbon dioxide storage space near Port Arthur and Beaumont, Texas. The project is a joint venture with minority shareholders Negotiations are currently underway with potential customers, Gustavson said, declining to disclose names. The area is home to large petrochemical, refinery, liquid natural gas and industrial gas operations with significant carbon dioxide footprints, he said. ""Bayou Bend could be one of the largest CO2 storage projects in the world. You're talking several million tons a year of storage,"" Gustavson said. The project has the potential for even more storage capacity depending on how much technical progress is made, the executive said. While the IEA has described carbon capture and storage as ""essential"" to slash emissions in sectors like heavy industry, agency director Fatih Birol issued a sharply worded statement in November calling on the oil and gas industry to let go of the ""illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution"" to climate change. Birol's comments came on the back of an ""We're not saying carbon capture can be implemented everywhere,"" SLB's Majkut said. ""As a matter of fact, the primary way to decarbonize should be energy efficiency, scale up of renewables, and effectively carbon capture shall be used on applications that you can't easily electrify, that you can't easily decarbonize otherwise."" Increasing carbon capture and storage to meet net-zero emissions goals in the U.S. will require a massive expansion of pipeline infrastructure. The Department of Energy ""The key is the right geology close by to concentrated emissions,"" Gustavson said. ""That's where we see this scaling fastest first, but over time, we will need to build more CO2 infrastructure to be able to transport CO2 much longer distances to access the same storage."" But the permitting process is challenging because pipelines often cross state lines, requiring lengthy approval from multiple jurisdictions and creating bottlenecks, Majkut said. Pipeline expansion has faced opposition in communities where residents are Denbury said in a The Energy Department says carbon dioxide pipelines have a better safety record than natural gas pipelines and other large infrastructure such as electric transmission. There have been no deaths from carbon dioxide pipelines over the past two decades and one injury in addition to the hospitalizations from the Satartia incident, according to the Transportation Department. There are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding carbon capture and storage, said Miklos, the executive at International Paper. But the Vicksburg project is an opportunity to carefully examine the technical and economic viability and the impact on climate over a multiyear period, he said. ""The primary questions are around the ability to do this in a way that is cost effective,"" he said.

The company is considered to be the industry gold standard for communications infrastructure, providing messaging, voice and email solutions to their customers. Twilio went public in But the problem is not solely lack of growth – Twilio is still growing at 8.5% per year. A bigger problem is that despite the level of revenue, even at $4.2 billion, the company has never even come close to being profitable. That is OK for a hyper-growth company. But companies with normal growth must show profitability to attract investors. Part of this problem is the inordinate amount of stock-based compensation Twilio pays: $676 million in 2023 (leading to an operating loss of $877 million). This has partly been the cause of the company's share count doubling since 2017 from approximately 90 million shares to 180 million shares. But there are several signs that the company has been heading in the right direction even prior to Sachem Head's appointment to the board. Stock-based compensation has declined in 2023 by 15.4% from $1.2 billion in 2022. Twilio has substantially reduced its headcount, cutting employees by 18% in the past year from 8,156 in 2022 to 5,867 in 2023. Moreover, Twilio's co-founder and former CEO Jeff Lawson resigned in The primary value creator here will be margin improvement. The company's nearest publicly traded peer Sinch, a smaller and lower quality business built through M&A of even smaller Twilio competitors, has generated positive operating profits and net income for several years with negligible to no stock-based compensation. Twilio should be able to do even better. While the company has demonstrated good intent and is doing a lot of the right things already, there is still plenty of upside potential on further margin expansion and reduction in stock-based compensation. This is a situation where the activist and management are like-minded, which led to a quick and quiet settlement rather than a public proxy fight. On March 30, Sachem Head received a board seat for Andy J. Stafman, partner at Sachem Head, and agreed to withdraw its notice of shareholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election to the board at the 2024 annual meeting. It is always a great activism engagement when the activist goes on the board to help management execute on a plan they all agree on, as opposed to convincing management that the activist's plan is better. We believe Stafman will be a valuable asset to Twilio in overseeing its margin expansion and other plans, but we also expect that he will hold management accountable if they fail to do so. Additionally, we think there is a strong possibility that Twilio gets its top-line growth up as well. Market intelligence and data providers Gartner and IDC still project an industry growth rate in the mid- to high-teens. As the market leader, Twilio should be at the high end of the range. Finally, Sachem Head is not the only activist actively engaged with Twilio.

While spousal IRA contributions make sense for some couples, there are other factors to consider before making deposits, said CFP Laura Mattia, CEO of Atlas Fiduciary Financial in Sarasota, Florida.

"There is officially one winner for the $1.128 billion A single ticket sold in New Jersey won the game's The lucky winner will choose between More from Personal Finance: Regardless of the payout option, ""you're losing almost half of it"" to taxes, said Albert Campo, a certified public accountant and president of AJC Accounting Services in Manalapan, New Jersey. New Jersey taxes Eight states, including California, Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming, Before seeing a penny of the jackpot, the winner will pay a 24% mandatory upfront federal withholding to the IRS. If they choose the $536.6 million cash option, the 24% withholding automatically reduces the prize by about $129 million. However, the jackpot pushes the winner into the top Of course, these are rough calculations. The winner's federal tax bill will also depend on other income, credits or deductions. As for state taxes, New Jersey automatically withholds 8% for payouts of more than $500,000, which will cost the winner about another $43 million up front. The state withholding covers ""a big chunk,"" but New Jersey's top tax bracket is 10.75%, Campo said. ""None of these winners really think about taxes"" until there's a hefty share going to the IRS and state government, said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based lawyer who has represented several lottery winners. The Mega Millions is not the only way to win big. The Powerball jackpot has reached an estimated $865 million without a big winner from Monday night's drawing. The chances of scoring the grand prize for that game are roughly 1 in 292 million.

"Katherine Dowling has an analogy that may be useful for investors thinking of It's ""like cayenne pepper,"" said Dowling, general counsel and chief compliance officer at Bitwise Asset Management, a crypto money manager. ""A little goes a long way"" in a portfolio, she explained earlier this month at Financial Advisor Magazine's annual Invest in Women conference in West Palm Beach, Florida. More from Personal Finance: Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and member of CNBC's ""The more volatile an asset class is, the less of it that you need,"" said Johnson, who founded Delancey Wealth Management, based in Washington, D.C. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, a category that should be considered an ""alternative investment,"" Johnson said. Other Allocating 2% or 3% of one's investment portfolio to crypto is ""more than enough,"" Johnson said. Let's say an asset grows by 50% this year, and an investor holds a 1% position. That's like having a 5% position in another asset that grew 10%, Johnson said. Whether investors buy in to crypto — and how much they hold — will depend on their For example, long-term investors in their mid-20s can afford to take more risk because they have ample time to make up for losses. Such a person may be able to stomach substantial financial losses and may reasonably hold 5% to 7% of their portfolio in crypto, Johnson added. However, that allocation would most likely not be appropriate for a 70-year-old investor who can't afford to subject their nest egg to major losses, he said. ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a very speculative investment and involves a high degree of risk,"" investment strategists at Wells Fargo Advisors wrote in a Crypto prices have been on a wild ride lately. Bitcoin Bitcoin prices had collapsed heading into 2022, and Prices have since quadrupled from their low point in November 2022, as of late Wednesday. They've soared more than 50% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up about 9%. Bitcoin is about eight times as volatile as the S&P 500, Johnson wrote in a Journal of Financial Planning article in December 2022, citing data from the Digital Asset Council for Financial Professionals. The ""It's still an incredibly volatile asset,"" Bitwise's Dowling said. ""It's not for everybody.""

"Rent prices The monthly cost for a one-bedroom apartment across the U.S. bumped up to $1,487, a 0.3% increase from February. The price of a typical two-bedroom apartment also jumped 0.5% to $1,847, according to a While prices are up overall, some metro areas saw declines. For example, the rent price for a one-bedroom apartment in Baltimore, Maryland, is $1,390, down 0.7% from a year ago, per Zumper. Arizona is unique, with rent decreases in all the major metro areas assessed. On a statewide level, the median price for one-bedroom apartments declined to $1,311 in March, about a 4% decline from $1,365 a year ago, according to Zumper data. The broader rental market's slight increase in prices may be a reflection of old seasonal patterns, experts say. ""It's kind of expected,"" said Crystal Chen, a spokeswoman for Zumper. ""When we get to the warmer months, that's when demand picks up."" More from Personal Finance: ""During the colder months of the year … the rental market tends to be cool,"" said Jacob Channel, a senior economist at LendingTree. ""As we get closer and closer to summer, we start to see rent prices increase in more places."" Yet, some fundamental factors such as supply and demand may also be reflected, said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Some markets in the country are cooling more than others. Prices in the Sun Belt and the intermountain areas are coming down, and Arizona is a prime example, Chen said. Zumper defines the intermountain region as Arizona, Nevada and Colorado. ""All of the Arizona cities on our report either had flat or declining year-over-year rates,"" she said. The city of Glendale, for example, had the largest rent decline, with one-bedroom prices down over 10% from this time last year. Arizona has a lot of supply coming online, keeping rent prices down in the area, Wachter explained. ""In the data, there's some evidence of fundamentals at play, in addition to seasonality,"" she said. Phoenix is expected to add more than 33,000 new units available this year and many buildings in the state are offering concessions, such as waived deposits or application fees and up to two months of free rent, Zumper found. ""If you're in that market, it's a great time for renters to snag an amenity-rich apartment that would have been out of reach otherwise,"" Chen said. While more supply is expected to surge in the Sun Belt and the intermountain region, a lot of Midwestern and Northeast markets are undersupplied, making rent prices push upward. ""The supply coming online absolutely does vary by market,"" Wachter said. Rent prices for one-bedroom apartments are up 25% in New York City from a year ago, according to Zumper. Rent costs and high competition also plague areas such as Columbus, Ohio, and Norfolk, Virginia. Yet, while prices increased, they've significantly declined from a year ago and even more compared with the market volatility from 2021 and 2022, when pent-up demand kept prices high. ""Rent prices are going up and they are expensive, but it's not suddenly skyrocketing again,"" Channel said. ""We don't expect to see national rates spike at all like in 2021 and 2022,"" Chen said. ""The seasonality is coming back after two crazy years."" While many factors affect housing affordability in the U.S., the main one, in simplest terms, is poor supply, Channel said. ""The more rental units that are built, the lower prices are likely to go, and I think Arizona shows that really well,"" he said.

"If you miss a doctor's appointment these days, you could get hit with a "" This happened to me recently for the first time, and the charge was a steep $150. When I complained to friends and family, I learned that my experience wasn't unusual — most had dealt with a similar fee. I talked to experts and consumer advocates about why such fees are becoming common, if the charges are fair to patients and how to best avoid them. ""I very strongly support such fees,"" said ""Patients who don't show up are taking up appointments which other patients could use,"" said Loewenstein, adding that ""without such a fee, patients have little if any disincentive for not bothering to cancel appointments well in advance."" More from Personal Finance: Certified financial planner and physician ""If a patient doesn't show up, that costs the practice money,"" said McClanahan, a member of Caitlin Donovan, But, she said, ""to solve this problem is not to charge patients more fees, which many can't afford."" She has heard of medical offices having success with call and text reminders to patients about their appointments. Patients should always be given the opportunity to bow out, she said. That doesn't always happen. Earlier this month, my sister, Janna, tried to call her doctor twice to cancel her appointment for the next day. ""I was in elevator music purgatory for over 20 minutes,"" she said. Both times, she didn't get through to anyone. Three weeks later, she got a bill for a $100 ""no-show"" fee. For my appointment, I did get a call the day before from the doctor's office. But when I told the woman I'd forgotten about the appointment and couldn't make it, she said I'd still be charged a cancellation fee. Adam Rust ""But if penalty fees become a profit center, it may incentivize trickery and deception,"" Rust said. In addition to sufficient reminders and opportunities to cancel appointments for patients, there can be other creative alternatives to ""no-show"" fees, Donovan said. She recently spoke to one medical group in Camden, New Jersey, that had a problem with patients standing them up. They started asking people why they hadn't come. Many said they just didn't have reliable transportation to get there. ""They implemented a ride share, which came at a cost to the office, but their attendance levels went right up and more than compensated for the cost of the rides,"" Donovan said. When you make a doctor's appointment, ask about the office's policy around late cancellations and missed appointments, Donovan said. If you're told you'll be charged for missing an appointment, ask if you can reschedule it instead. You can also try asking the office if they can waive the charge if you find it unfair or if you can't afford it, she said. They should work with you. ""Ultimately, these fees are discretionary and I would be reluctant to work with any office that inflexibly charged them,"" Donovan said. On a practical note, debt owed to a doctor's or dentist's office is considered medical debt, a spokesperson for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told CNBC. Such debts that are less than $500 are not reported to the credit bureaus, they added. As a result, it seems unlikely that a no-show fee would harm your credit. When my sister Janna got her no-show invoice, she simply called the number on the bill and explained that she'd tried without success to cancel her appointment. The customer service agent agreed to waive the fee immediately. ""I feel like they have a system where they send out the bill for a no-show and then if people make the effort of calling it to question it, they'll get rid of it,"" Janna said.

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades.

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>

MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides.

"The idea of raising the Social Security ""No one should have to work longer than they want to,"" Fink recently ""But I do think it's a bit crazy that our anchor idea for the right retirement age — 65 years old — originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire,"" wrote Fink, who is 71. Republicans have touted raising the retirement age. Former presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she would raise the Social Security retirement age for The reason for the suggestion largely comes down to demographics. In the 1950s, many people who worked and paid into Social Security never lived long enough to retire and start receiving benefits, Fink noted. Today, the chances are higher that certain retirees over 65 may still be collecting Social Security checks until age 90, he wrote. Meanwhile, the number of baby boomers who reach age 65 is surging to historic levels. More than 11,200 Americans are expected to turn 65 every day — for a total of More from Personal Finance: That's as Social Security is facing a looming shortfall. The trust fund used to pay retirement and survivors benefits is projected to ""Age 65 is the anchor that is a cultural age which we have hung our retirement hat to for decades,"" said Jason Fichtner, chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center and executive director of the Alliance for Lifetime Income's Retirement Income Institute. ""It is no longer, I think, relevant,"" he said. Today, a new Social Security full retirement age of 67 is still getting phased in, prompted by changes enacted by Congress in 1983. Full retirement age is the point at which retirees stand to receive 100% of the benefits they've earned. For many years, Social Security's full retirement age Social Security benefits are available starting from age 62, "" Retirees who wait to claim until age 70 stand to get the biggest benefit — with an increase of up to 8% for each year they wait past full retirement age. Yet fewer than 10% of claimants wait until that age, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research and author of the book ""Work, Retire, Repeat: The Uncertainty of Retirement in the New Economy."" As lawmakers face a deadline to make changes and address the program shortfall, they generally may choose from a limited menu of options — hiking taxes, cutting benefits or a combination of both. Raising the retirement age, which is often presented as another option, is really a benefit cut, said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ""When you change the retirement age, it's particularly painful to those who have to keep retiring at 62, people with health issues or people in professions where no jobs are available,"" Munnell said. Congress may eventually raise the full retirement age to 69, predicts Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, even though Democrats have promised not to make that change. ""When you look at countries around the world that have had underfunded pension systems, they raise the retirement age,"" Biggs said. ""It's just a very, very common fix."" For each year the Social Security full retirement age is increased, that would cut benefits by a little under 7%, Biggs said. Pushing the age to 69 would repair less than one-fifth of Social Security's shortfall, so other reforms would also be necessary, Biggs said. Moreover, a new higher retirement age would have to be phased in much faster than the 40-year window used for the last increase, he said. Researchers and policy experts who have spent years studying Social Security's shortfall have their own wish lists for the changes they would make. Fichtner, who supports raising the retirement age, said that change would need to be paired with a higher minimum benefit, so as not to punish workers who cannot work longer. ""Some people have the ability to work, some people want to work, but some people can't,"" Fichtner said. ""It's important that we maintain a healthy minimum benefit amount at age 62."" Increases to the retirement age could be set to automatically adjust to changes in longevity, much as the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustments are tied to inflation, he said. Other experts would opt for different changes in place of raising the retirement age. Biggs advocates for moving to Munnell argues the most effective benefit cut would be to reduce the replacement rates for higher-income workers. Ultimately, workers want to retire on their own terms — at the age they want and with enough money to live comfortably. To make that more possible, employers need to engage older workers so they feel comfortable staying in the workforce, said David Blanchett, managing director and head of retirement research at PGIM DC Solutions. ""There's still potentially some implicit bias towards older Americans leaving the workforce,"" Blanchett said. ""If we can have a president over the age of 75 or 80, I think as a society we should be able to find more ways to accommodate older workers.""

"A majority of Americans, 95%, said they plan to look for a new job this year, according to a January 2024 Money is a big reason, with 45% of workers saying they need a higher income. Data from the Federal Reserve More from Personal Finance: Kyyah Abdul, a 29-year-old biotech and pharmaceutical global regulatory affairs consultant, knew early in her career that she eventually wanted to work for herself. ""I've always had this idea of where I wanted to end up in a certain amount of time,"" Abdul, who is based in Los Angeles, told CNBC. ""I told myself, 'Okay, around the age of 30, try and get enough experience and exposure to the things that are required to have a consulting firm.'"" Abdul has focused on upskilling rather than only money. She's changed jobs in her industry six times since 2016. The first time she switched jobs, she took a $20,000 pay cut in order to gain experience. ""I knew that that was okay because it would come back tenfold based on the experience I was going to be getting at the new place of work,"" she said. ""I ended up ... almost doubling my salary after a year and a half."" Abdul told CNBC she continued to grow her salary through promotions and other job hops.

The change is the first of several updates the Social Security Administration said it plans to put in place for SSI beneficiaries and applicants.

""Many companies are still holding back and waiting. Manufacturing will be a very interesting one to watch. There has recently been a bit of an improvement in durable goods manufacturing job openings. The checks are in the mail."" Markets expect the Fed to start cutting rates in June, though the outlook has become less certain in recent weeks as policymakers weigh the direction of inflation. Despite the uncertainty over monetary policy, companies have forged ahead with hiring. There have been mixed signs regarding layoffs. This was the The department's ""I haven't seen layoffs,"" said Tom Gimbel, founder and CEO of LaSalle Network, a staffing and recruiting firm. ""What I keep seeing is the small- and mid-market going after market share, and the hiring seems to come in that bracket.

The trend continued into February, as But other sectors are still showing demand. Job postings surged 102% for physicians and surgeons, 83% for therapists and 82% for civil engineering. In its most recent survey of economic conditions, the Fed found that the ultra-tight labor market has loosened somewhat, but there are still active pockets. ""Businesses generally found it easier to fill open positions and to find qualified applicants, although difficulties persisted attracting workers for highly skilled positions, including health-care professionals, engineers, and skilled trades specialists such as welders and mechanics,"" the Fed said in its The report precedes each Fed meeting by two weeks and helps inform policymakers on trends across the economy. Business contacts noted that wages are continuing to rise, though at a slower pace. Wage gains are an important piece of the inflation puzzle. Friday's report is expected to show average hourly earnings up just 0.2% on the month, down from a 0.6% jump in January, though still increasing at a 4.4% pace. The big monthly move in January came largely from a decline in the average work week, which elevates the appearance of average hourly earnings. Even with the hotter than expected inflation numbers, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank is ""A lot of the hourly wage increases were driven by two things primarily: more liberal municipalities, and a scarcity of workers from Covid,"" Gimbel said.

Staff projections for inflation in 2024 were updated to an average 2.3% from 2.7%. Looking ahead, staff see inflation hitting the ECB's 2% target in 2025 and cooling further to 1.9% in 2026.

""We are more confident as a result, but we are not sufficiently confident, and we need more evidence, more data, and we know this data will come in the next few months. We will know a little more in April and a lot more in June."" Policymakers have repeatedly signaled May as a key date, since wage settlements are set to be released that month. The ECB will be ""laser-focused"" on two areas of inflation that could surprise, namely wage growth and profit margins, Lagarde said. There could also be a downside surprise to the outlook if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected or the global economic environment worsens unexpectedly, she added.

""The numbers were quite reassuring actually, we were not expecting any cut today,"" he told CNBC's Silvia Amaro. ""Today's decision looks to be relatively dovish,"" he said, given that both growth and inflation forecasts moved lower.

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios. At the end of the day, it’s not about investors.”</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/johnkonrad/status/1776625227100721497"">Captain John Konrad, CEO of gCaptain</a>, a website specializing in tracking the shipping industry, blames the ""West Point Mafia"" and decades of land wars in the Middle East for a hollowed-out US Navy that was entirely ""unprepared"" for the salvage operation of the collapsed 1.6-mile-long Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. </p>

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense.""</p>

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""dd5460a7-03ef-4383-a168-31130ecfa761"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""281"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/powell-thumb-1024x576.jpg?itok=pT4WF30F"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

"Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco reported a 25% decline in profit to $121.3 billion in 2023, down from $161.1 billion in 2022, and boosted its mega dividend payout despite ""economic headwinds."" Aramco raised its base dividend for the fourth quarter by 4% to $20.3 billion dollars, and lifted its performance-linked dividend by 9% to $10.8 billion, resulting in a $31 billion dollar payday for the Saudi government and Aramco stakeholders. Despite the earnings decline, the result still represents Aramco's second-highest net income on record, ""The year-on-year decrease can be attributed to lower crude oil prices and volumes sold, as well as reduced refining and chemicals margins, partially offset by a decrease in production royalties during the year and lower income taxes and zakat,"" Aramco said in a statement. Aramco said total revenue also fell 17% to $440.88 billion, down from $535.19 billion last year. Free cash flow also fell to $101.2 billion in 2023, compared to $148.5 billion in 2022. ""It was a year that saw global oil demand reach record levels despite geopolitical volatility, economic headwinds, and inflationary pressures,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told the earnings call on Sunday. ""We expect the global oil market to remain healthy over the remainder of this year, and we expect it to be fairly robust with growth of about 1.5 million barrels,"" Nasser added. Saudi Arabia led OPEC+ countries last week in a decision to The earnings come after the Saudi government transferred an additional 8% of Aramco shares, worth $164 billion, to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Yasir Al-Rumayyan is both the chairman of Aramco's Board of Directors and the governor of the PIF. The share transfer to PIF is one of the largest transactions Aramco has undertaken since listing, and will allow the PIF to benefit from Aramco's mega dividend payout policy. Aramco paid $97.8 billion in dividends in 2023, up 30% from 2022. The full year performance-linked dividend for 2024 is expected to be $43.1 billion alone. The share transfer ""doesn't change anything,"" Aramco Chief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed told the earnings call. ""We're healthy and we have no need to issue new equity,"" he said in response to a question about speculation of a PIF already owned 4% of Aramco, and controls Sanabil, a financial investment firm, which owns 4% of Aramco as well. The PIF's 16% state in Aramco, worth an estimated $328 billion, will strengthen the fund's financial position and boost its ability to The new Aramco stake also pushes PIF closer to achieving its end-2025 target of $1 trillion in assets under management. Aramco confirmed it would ""The recent directive from the government to maintain our Maximum Sustainable Capacity at 12 million barrels per day provides increased flexibility, as well as an opportunity to focus on increasing gas production and growing our liquids-to-chemicals business,"" Nasser said. Aramco's average hydrocarbon production was 12.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023, including 10.7 million barrels per day of total liquids.

"Unemployment among Black women fell in February as the number of those looking for work increased, data released Friday by the U.S. government showed. The The percentage of unemployed Black women, however, fell to 4.4% from 4.8%. This comes as the labor force participation rate within the group — which measures how many workers are currently employed or searching for work — rises to 63.4% from 62.9%. Valerie Wilson, director at the Economic Policy Institute's Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy, said that the labor market is showing positive signs for Black women. She pointed to the decrease in the unemployment rate, while the employment/population ratio edged higher to 60.6% from 59.9%. ""That seems unambiguously that things are moving in a positive direction,"" she told CNBC. As for why the cohort was able to buck the trend, Wilson said it could be due to the specific industries that added jobs last month. ""We saw increases in health care and government services, which are sectors where we see a significant number of Black women being employed,"" she said. ""The fact that those were two sectors that added jobs and had the highest job growth in the last month is probably a factor in that increased participation rate and reduced unemployment rate."" For Hispanic women, unemployment rose to 5% from 4.3%. Overall, with the unemployment rate still sitting below 4%, this month's report paints the picture of a strong labor market, Wilson said. ""At this point, at that lower rate of unemployment, you're not going to get huge shifts as long as that growth is still positive on the net,"" she said. While economists could still see slight moves from month to month, at the current pace of U.S. job growth, the labor market should remain stable and steady. — CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report.

"Inflation rose again in February, keeping the Federal Reserve on course to wait at least until the summer before starting to lower interest rates.

Both were one-tenth of a percentage point higher than forecast. While the 12-month pace is off the inflation peak in mid-2022, it remains well above the Fed's 2% goal as the central bank approaches its two-day policy meeting in a week. A 2.3% increase in energy costs helped boost the headline inflation number. Food costs were flat on the month, while shelter rose another 0.4%. The BLS reported that the increases in energy and shelter amounted to more than 60% of the total gain. Gasoline jumped 3.8% on the month while owners' equivalent rent, a hypothetical gauge of what homeowners could get renting their properties, rose 0.4%. ""Inflation continues to churn above 3%, and once again shelter costs were the main villain. With home prices expected to rise this year and rents falling only slowly, the long-awaited fall in shelter prices isn't coming to the rescue any time soon,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. ""Reports like January's and February's aren't going to prompt the Fed to lower rates quickly."" Airline fares posted a 3.6% increase, apparel prices rose 0.6% and used vehicles were up 0.5%. Medical care services, which helped feed a higher-than-expected CPI increase in January, decreased 0.1% last month. The year-over-year increase for headline CPI was 0.1 percentage point higher than January, while core was one-tenth of a point lower. Wall Street While the 12-month pace is off the inflation peak in mid-2022, it remains well above the Fed's 2% goal as the central bank approaches its two-day policy meeting in a week. Fed officials in recent weeks both have signaled that rate cuts are likely at some point this year and expressed caution about letting up too soon in the battle against high prices. The statement after the January meeting indicated that policymakers need ""greater confidence"" that inflation is moving back to target. Chair Jerome Powell, in congressional testimony last week, echoed those concerns, though he did mention that the Fed is probably ""not far"" from the point where it can start easing up on monetary policy. Tuesday's report ""leaves Fed officials some way from attaining the 'greater confidence' needed to begin cutting interest rates,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. For financial markets, the shift in the Fed stance from its apparent policy pivot in late 2023 has meant a repricing on the pace of rate cuts. Where futures traders entered the year expecting cuts to start coming in March, with six or seven total on the year, they have pushed out the first reduction to June, with two or three to follow, assuming cuts in quarter percentage point increments. A bustling economy has helped the Fed focus on incoming data and allowed policymakers to avoid having to rush to lower rates. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5% annualized pace in 2023 and is on pace to increase at a 2.5% pace in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker. One key ingredient in that growth has been a resilient consumer boosted by a strong labor market. The economy Such strength can be a double-edged sword: While the growth in the face of aggressive rate hikes has bought the Fed time on policy, it also raises concerns that inflation could be more durable than expected. Housing costs in particular have caused concern. Shelter comprises about one-third of the CPI weighting and has been slow to decelerate, at least according to the BLS measure. Fed officials see rental prices coming down through the year, and other measures outside the CPI computation of owners-equivalent rent have shown easing price pressures. Correction: The BLS reported that the increases in energy and shelter amounted to more than 60% of the total gain. An earlier version misstated a sector.

"Rising gasoline prices likely put a floor under Economists expect that prices across a broad spectrum of goods and services rose 0.4% on the month, just ahead of the January pace for 0.3%, according to the Dow Jones consensus. Excluding food and energy, the increase for core inflation is forecast at a 0.3% gain, also one-tenth of a percentage point above the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, headline inflation is expected to show a 3.1% gain and core inflation a 3.7% increase when the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its latest reading on the consumer price index Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The respective 12-month readings in January were 3.1% and 3.9%. Though it has fallen sharply since its peak in mid-2022, inflation's resilience almost certainly will assure no Fed rate cuts at its next meeting March 19-20, and possibly into the summer, according to current market pricing. Markets were rattled in January when the ""While we do not expect the trend in inflation to re-accelerate this year, less clear progress over the next few months is likely to keep the Fed searching for more confidence that inflation is on course to return to target on a sustained basis,"" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said in a recent client note. Energy prices had eased earlier in the winter, putting some downward pressure on headline readings. But Wells Fargo estimates that energy services rebounded 4% in February, leading to an increase at the pump, where a gallon of regular gas is up about 20 cents, or more than 6%, from a month ago, The bank also estimates that goods prices have held their ground despite an easing in supply chain pressures and pressure from higher interest rates. On the brighter side, the House said lower prices on travel, medical care and other services helped keep inflation in check. Still, Wells Fargo has raised its full-year inflation forecast. The bank's economists now expect core CPI to run at a 3.3% rate this year, up from the previous 2.8% estimate. Focusing on the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the preferred Fed gauge, Wells Fargo sees inflation at 2.5% for the year, versus a prior estimate of 2.2%. Wells Fargo isn't alone in expecting a higher pace of inflation. In its February survey of consumers, While increases in gas prices can play an outsize role in monthly fluctuations for the survey, the outlook for gas price increases was actually relatively benign.

The two indexes will be the last inflation data the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will see before it meets next week. ",,2024-04-07,,A key inflation reading is due out Tuesday morning. Here's what to expect
"Consumers increasingly doubt the While the outlook over the next year was unchanged at 3%, that wasn't the case for the longer term. At the three-year range, expectations rose 0.3 percentage point to 2.7%, while the five-year outlook jumped even more, up 0.4 percentage point to 2.9%. All three are well ahead of the Fed's 2% goal for 12-month inflation, indicating the central bank may need to keep policy tighter for longer. Economists and policymakers consider expectations as a key factor in viewing the path of inflation, so the ""Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Headline inflation as judged by personal consumption expenditures prices, the Fed's preferred gauge, rose 2.4% in January — or 2.8% at the core level when excluding food and energy. Those readings represented progress in the Fed's battle, though some economists have warned the ""last mile"" back to 2% would be the most difficult. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady when it meets next week, with market pricing pointing to a cut in June followed possibly by three more before the end of the year, according to CME Group gauging of futures markets. Other inflation measures in the February survey offered some hope. Most notably, the outlook for rent costs decreased to 6.1%, down 0.3 percentage point for the lowest reading since December 2020. Shelter has remained the most stubborn of the inflation components but one Fed officials think will ease as the year goes on and tenants negotiate new leases. Elsewhere, the one-year outlook for gas rose 0.1 percentage point to 4.3%, fell by 1.8 percentage points to 6.8% for medical care and was unchanged for food at 4.9%. The outlook for household spending over the next year rose to 5.2%, up 0.2 percentage point. Respondents also indicated some unease over job prospects. The perceived probability for losing one's job in the next year rose to 14.5%, an increase of 2.7 percentage points.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 275,000 for the month while the jobless rate moved higher to 3.9%, the February was a step higher in growth from January, which saw a steep downward revision to 229,000, from the initially reported 353,000. Job growth in December also was revised down to 290,000 from 333,000, bringing the two-month total to 167,000 fewer jobs than initially reported. The jobless level increased as the Average hourly earnings, watched closely as an inflation indicator, showed a slightly less than expected increase for the month and a deceleration from a year ago. Wages rose just 0.1% on the month, one-tenth of a percentage point below the estimate, and were up 4.3% from a year ago, down from the 4.5% gain in January and slightly below the 4.4% estimate. Hours worked rebounded from a slip in January, with the average work week up to 34.3 hours, an increase of 0.1 percentage point. The jobs numbers likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this year, though the timing and extent remain uncertain. Stocks rose Friday ""It's got literally a data point for every view on the spectrum,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said of the report. Those range from ""the economy is plunging into a recession to Goldilocks, everything is fine, nothing to see here. It's certainly mixed,"" she added. Job creation skewed toward part-time positions. Full-time jobs decreased by 187,000 while part-time employment rose by 51,000, according to the household survey. An alternative jobless measure, sometimes called the ""real"" unemployment rate, that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons rose slightly to 7.3%. From a sector standpoint, health care led with 67,000 new jobs. Government again was a big contributor, with 52,000, while restaurants and bars added 42,000 and social assistance increased by 24,000. Other gainers included construction (23,000), transportation and warehousing (20,000) and retail (19,000).

It doesn't really give us a whole lot of information, other than we can qualitatively say, we're still growing jobs at a good pace and wages are still a little bit higher than we would like,"" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas. North added that the report probably ""doesn't change the narrative"" for the Fed, though he thinks the first cut may not happen until July. In recent days, Fed officials have sent mixed signals, indicating that inflation is cooling but not by enough to warrant the first interest rate cuts since the early days of the Covid pandemic crisis. Fed Chair Along with that, he said inflation ""has eased notably"" though still not showing enough progress back to the Fed's 2% target. But on Thursday he told the Senate Banking Committee that the state of the economy ""We've got a data-dependent fed, which means we're all at the mercy of the data,"" Sonders said. ""Big moves outside the range of consensus on labor market data, on inflation data, can move the needle. But in-line or mixed numbers, then we all just jump to the next report.""

"Consumer spending bounced back in February from a January dip, with a little help from leap day. But sales still registered good gains even after correcting for that extra spending day. The CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor, derived from actual credit card spending data from Affinity Solutions, rose 1.06% in February, when excluding autos and gas. It increased 0.95% when taking out restaurants as well, the Retail Monitor's core measure. Removing the effect of the leap day, sales rose 0.4%, or less than half of the unadjusted gain, but they were still up from the 0.2% decline in January. Taking out restaurants, the Retail Monitor adjusted for the leap day was up 0.3%, compared with a 0.04% gain in January. ""While the future direction of interest rates and inflation remains uncertain, it's clear that a strong job market and increases in real wages are continuing to support spending,"" said Matt Shay, president of the National Retail Federation. Looking at individual sectors, not adjusted for the leap day: The sector data was also impacted by the leap day and the index overall could differ more sharply this month from the Census Bureau retail data than it normally does. Unlike survey-based numbers collected by the Census Bureau, the Retail Monitor uses actual, anonymized credit and debit card purchase data compiled by Affinity and is not revised monthly or annually. Economists are looking for a 0.8% gain in the Census retail report on Thursday, a complete reversal of the 0.8% decline in January.

Treasury yields climbed on the back of the report. A busy morning for economic data also showed that retail sales rebounded, up 0.6% on the month, according to Commerce Department data that is adjusted seasonally but not for inflation. The increase helped reverse a downwardly revised 1.1% slump in January, but was still below the estimate for a 0.8% rise. Also, The market focused on the PPI release, which comes two days after the consumer price index, which measures what consumers pay in the marketplace, The PPI is considered a leading indicator for inflation as it indicates costs early in the supply chain. The BLS reported that about two-thirds of the rise in the headline PPI came from a 1.2% surge in goods prices, the biggest increase since August 2023. As with the CPI, the acceleration was traced to energy prices, with saw a 4.4% increase in the final demand measure. Gasoline prices jumped 6.8% at the wholesale level. Services costs increased 0.3%, boosted by a 3.8% surge in traveler accommodation services. On the retail sales side, the data indicated that consumers kept ahead of CPI inflation, which increased 0.4% on the month, though sales were still sluggish. Excluding auto, retail sales rose 0.3%, one-tenth of a percentage point below expectations. Motor vehicle parts and dealers saw an increase of 1.6%, second only to the 2.2% gain for building material and garden centers on the month. Despite slumping prices, gasoline stations reported an increase of 0.9%. Electronics and appliance sales rose 1.5% while miscellaneous store sales climbed 0.6% and restaurants and bars were up 0.4%. Retail sales posted a 1.5% gain on a year-over-year basis, below the 3.2% increase in the CPI. Inflation-related data is being watched closely on Wall Street, ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting starting next Tuesday. While the central bank is almost certain to hold its benchmark interest rate in place, markets will be looking for clues about the future of monetary policy. Futures pricing is pointing toward the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to start cutting interest rates in June, with three quarter-percentage point decreases expected this year.

"Turkey's central bank is opting for a different monetary tightening method as it grapples with climbing inflation, after previously signaling that its rate-hiking cycle was over. The institution sent a directive to lenders, effective Friday, instructing them to put parts of their required lira reserves into blocked accounts. That's pushed loan rates up higher and cut the sizes of some banks' loan limits, with some lenders shrinking their commercial loan limits to 100,000 lira, or $3,100, ""Some banks have stopped lending. Some banks even recall their already granted loans. This is going to cause further liquidity squeeze,"" Arda Tunca, an Istanbul-based economist at PolitikYol, told CNBC. ""If a central bank is willing to reduce the rate of inflation, liquidity conditions should be squeezed for sure, but the methodology is of utmost importance,"" he said. ""If the methodology is wrong, market expectations can't be managed."" Indeed, Turkish bank stocks dipped after the news Thursday. Economic data platform Emerging Market Watch posted on X, describing the central bank as taking ""another tightening step via reserve requirements."" Analysts at London-based firm Capital Economics made similar observations. ""In the past month, new quantitative and credit tightening tools have been announced,"" the firm wrote in a research note.

"The European Central Bank must take its time to get interest rate cuts right and will have a clearer picture of inflationary pressures in June, the institution's chief economist told CNBC. ""A lot of evidence is accumulating, but what's also fair to say is that the transition from this holding phase, we've been on hold since last September since a substantial hiking cycle, we do have to take our time to get that right, from holding to dialing back restrictions,"" Philip Lane told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Thursday. Lane, a Governing Council member, said the euro zone central bank's Inflation In line with the ECB's March messaging, Lane said that more data was required, particularly around wages, and that the Governing Council would ""learn a lot by April, a lot more by June"" — the dates of its next two meetings. In a news conference after the March meeting, ECB President Christine Lagarde said market pricing on the timing of rate cuts — which indicate a start in June as of Thursday — ""seems to be converging better"" with the central bank's view. June emerged as a key date in market commentary, as it's set to mark the first meeting where the ECB can assess spring data on wage negotiations for the year. Asked about other colleagues on the ECB's Governing Council who have suggested rate cuts could take place before the summer, Lane said he believed this was a reference to the second quarter, which would include June. ""I think Q2 is a time when we will be far enough into 2024 to see more of the wage dynamic, to see more of the price pressures."" He stressed that it was important, in his own role, to ""avoid trying to provide calendar guidance to the market."" ""Once we are sufficiently confident that we will get back to target in a sustainable manner, in a timely manner, that's the right time to move to the next phase,"" he said. Policymakers have repeatedly stressed that many of the causes of the inflationary cycle have subsided, such as the energy price spike and supply chain issues. But they remain concerned about domestic inflationary pressures from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey Lane said Thursday that, while the ECB's forecast relied on some moderation in wage growth, it was ""important"" for people's inflation-adjusted salaries to improve, and that companies should shoulder lower profits to allow this to happen. ""Wages were not the source of this inflation problem. But in terms of making sure we get back to target, the interplay between wages and profits, our forecast is built on a degree of wage deceleration,"" he said. ""It's important to say, we need to see workers' real incomes improve, to rebuild, not just this year, [but] the year after. So we allow for higher to normal wage increases."" Lane added, ""But we also need to see, essentially, firms absorbing a fair amount of that in lower profits. Profits were quite high in 2022, there is some room for profits to come down. And that is part of the open questions we have."" ",,2024-04-07,,"European Central Bank chief economist: Must 'take our time' on rate cuts, clearer picture due in June"
"From consumer and wholesale prices to longer-term public expectations, reports this week served up multiple reminders this week that Data across the board showed pressures increasing at a faster-than-expected pace, causing concern that inflation could be more durable than policymakers had anticipated. The bad news began Monday when Those reports will provide a lot for the Fed to think about when it convenes Tuesday for a two-day policy meeting where it will decide on the current level of interest rates and offer an updated look on where it sees things heading longer term. ""If the data keep rolling in like this, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify a pre-emptive rate cut,"" wrote Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. Taken together, the numbers show ""the great disinflation has stalled and looks to be reversing."" The latest jolt on inflation came Thursday when the Labor Department reported that the Earlier in the week, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said the While surging energy prices contributed substantially to the increase in both inflation figures, there also was evidence of broader pressures from items such as airline fares, used vehicles and beef. In fact, at a time when the focus has shifted to services inflation, goods prices leaped 1.2% in the PPI reading, the biggest increase since August 2023. ""There continue to be signs in PPI data that the disinflation in goods prices is largely coming to an end,"" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark wrote after the report's release. Taken together, the stubbornly high prices appear to have taken their toll on both consumer expectations and behavior. While substantially lower than its mid-2022 peak, inflation has proved resilient despite the Fed's 11 rate hikes totaling 5.25 percentage points and its moves to cut its bond holdings by nearly $1.4 trillion. The New York Fed survey showed that three- and five-year inflation expectations respectively moved up to 2.7% and 2.9%. While such surveys often can be especially sensitive to gas prices, this one showed energy expectations relatively constant and reflected doubt from consumers that the Fed will achieve its 2% mandate anytime soon. On a policy level, that could mean the Fed Along with the surprisingly strong inflation data, consumers are showing signs of letting up on their massive shopping spree over the past few years. Over the past year, sales increased 1.5%, or 1.7 percentage points below the headline inflation rate and 2.3 points below the core rate that excludes food and energy. Investors will get a look at how policymakers feel when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee convenes next week. The FOMC will release both its rate decision — there's virtually no chance of a change in either direction — as well as its revised outlook for longer-term rates, gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment. Blitz, the TS Lombard economist, said the Fed is correct to take a patient approach, after officials said in recent weeks that ""The Fed has time to watch and wait,"" he said, adding that ""odds of the next move being a hike [are] greater than zero.""

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

"Inflation rose in line with expectations in February, likely keeping the Federal Reserve on hold before it can start considering interest rate cuts, according to a measure the central bank considers its more important barometer. The Including volatile food and energy costs, the headline PCE reading showed a 0.3% increase for the month and 2.5% at the 12-month rate, compared to estimates for 0.4% and 2.5%. Both the stock and bond markets were closed in observance of the Good Friday holiday. While the Fed looks at both measures when making policy, it considers core to be a better gauge of long-term inflation pressures. The Fed targets 2% annual inflation; core PCE inflation hasn't been below that level in three years. ""Nothing really super surprising. Obviously not the numbers the Fed wants to see, but I don't think this is going to catch anybody off guard when they come back to work on Monday,"" Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, told CNBC. ""I think everybody is going to pivot to labor pretty quickly and say well maybe if we see some weakness and cracks over here, this little stickiness in inflation and PCE isn't going to matter as much."" Rising energy costs helped push up the headline reading, with a 2.3% increase. The food index edged up 0.1%. Inflation pressures came more from the goods side, which rose 0.5%, compared to the 0.3% increase for services. That countered the trend over the past year, during which services rose 3.8% while goods actually fell by 0.2%. Other upward pressure came from international travel services, air transportation, and financial services and insurance. On the goods side, the motor vehicles and parts category was the biggest contributor. Along with the inflation increase, consumer spending shot up 0.8% on the month, well ahead of the 0.5% estimate, possibly indicating additional inflation pressures. Personal income increased 0.3%, slightly softer than the 0.4% estimate. The release comes a little more than a week after the central bank again held its benchmark short-term borrowing rate steady and indicated it still has not seen enough progress on inflation to consider cutting. In their quarterly update of rate projections, members of the Federal Open Market Committee again pointed to three quarter-percentage point cuts this year and in 2025. Markets expect the Fed to remain on hold again when it releases its decision on May 1, then begin cutting at the June 11-12 meeting.

"The Swiss National Bank on Thursday surprised the market with a decision to lower its main policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5%, saying national inflation is likely to stay below 2% for the foreseeable future. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the Swiss central bank to hold rates at 1.75%. ""For some months now, inflation has been back below 2% and thus in the range the SNB equates with price stability. According to the new forecast, inflation is also likely to remain in this range over the next few years,"" the bank said. Swiss inflation continued to fall in February, hitting 1.2%. The SNB also reduced its annual inflation forecasts. The bank now sees average inflation reaching 1.4% in 2024, down from its 1.9% estimate in December, and 1.2% for 2025, trimmed from the previous 1.6% estimate. Its first forecast for 2026 puts average inflation at 1.1% over the period. Following the announcement, analysts at Capital Economics said they expect two more SNB rate cuts over the course of this year, ""with the Bank sounding more dovish and inflation likely to undershoot its forecasts."" ""We think inflation will come in even lower than the new SNB forecasts imply and remain around the current level of 1.2% before falling to below 1.0% next year. Accordingly, we forecast the SNB to cut rates at the September and December meetings taking the policy rate to 1%, where we think it will remain throughout 2025 and 2026,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note. The September meeting is likely to be the last under the stewardship of SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan, who will step down at the end of that month after 12 years at the helm. The SNB said Swiss economic growth is ""likely to remain modest in the coming quarters,"" with the GDP poised to expand by roughly 1% this year. ""Our forecast for Switzerland, as for the global economy, is subject to significant uncertainty. The main risk is weaker economic activity abroad. Momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets has weakened noticeably in recent quarters,"" the SNB said. ""However, the vulnerabilities in these markets remain."" On a macro level, the SNB flagged ""moderate"" global economic growth in the coming quarters, along with likely falls in inflation partly thanks to restrictive monetary policy strategies. It nevertheless acknowledged ""significant risks"" and geopolitical tensions that could cloud the international economic horizon. In a TV interview with CNBC's Silvia Amaro, Jordan said that the improved inflation forecast has given the bank the breathing room to lower rates, but refused to be drawn on the inevitability of three cuts this year. ""We will see in June whether the situation is different, whether inflationary pressure continues to decline, then we'll make a new decision in June,"" he said, acknowledging that the bank remains ready to intercede in the foreign exchange market ""if necessary"" to defend the Swiss franc. High interest rates typically prop up currencies and weaken the relative value of other coins against them. ""We said very clearly that we remain ... available to intervene in the foreign exchange market, if necessary. So we can use this instrument in order to make sure that monetary conditions remain appropriate,"" Jordan noted. He fell short of commenting on whether other central banks will take a page from the SNB's trailblazing book and loosen their monetary policy, but signaled no concerns over the potential impact their moves may have on the Swiss currency. ""We will profit from a situation where we have price stability globally. Of course, it could have an impact on interest rate differentials, but I think a situation where the price stability is re-established everywhere, this is something that is positive for the global economy, and so also for Switzerland,"" he said. Switzerland is the first advanced economy to cut interest rates following a prolonged period of high inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on global trade and Russia's war in Ukraine. Switzerland was also affected by jitters in the banking space last year, when the government stepped in to facilitate Jordan on Thursday stressed to CNBC the importance of liquidity to the Swiss banking sector. ""A key message from us is always that they have to prepare their collateral, so that this collateral ... in case they need additional liquidity,"" he said. Asked whether Swiss lenders are doing enough in this direction, Jordan said there were ""very good discussions in Switzerland at the moment"" between banks and the SNB. ""The situation of March last year and also in the United States made it very clear also to smaller banks that liquidity issues could be a problem,"" he said. ""I think we are on the good way in order to make sure that sufficient collateral will be available in an emergency case ... but it's very important that we continue to go in that direction.""

"As legal battles over reproductive rights increase across the U.S., one area that could be impacted is egg freezing. In February, the Alabama state Supreme Court ruled that all embryos created through in vitro fertilization Women who choose to undergo reproductive technology procedures such as egg freezing face a long road riddled with obstacles. Here's a look into the driving forces behind egg freezing and the financial, social and emotional costs that come with it — based on personal experiences from women across the country. There's a notion that most women delaying motherhood are doing so to focus on other aspects of their lives, such as their careers. That's not so much the case anymore, according to Marcia Inhorn, a professor specializing in medical anthropology at Yale University. ""The majority of women who freeze their eggs are doing it because they have not found a partner. I call that the mating gap — the lack of eligible, educated, equal partners,"" Inhorn, who last year authored the book ""Motherhood on Ice: The Mating Gap and Why Women Freeze Their Eggs,"" told CNBC. This problem stems from the fact that today, women are receiving higher education at greater rates than men. Inhorn noted that women are outperforming men in higher education in 60% of countries, and that in the United States alone there are 27% more women than men in higher education. ""The result is that, for women who are highly educated in America and of reproductive age — between 20 and 39 — there literally are millions too few college-educated men,"" Inhorn added. Another reason women freeze their eggs is the sense of empowerment the procedure brings them. Fundamentally, Inhorn believes that this freedom that egg freezing allows is what ultimately draws increasingly younger women to the procedure. ""It gives you a little reprieve, a little extra time,"" she said. This statement is one that reproductive endocrinologists and fertility specialists Drs. Nicole Noyes and Aimee Eyvazzadeh agree with. Noyes, who has worked in the fertility industry since 2004 and is based in New York, has seen a noticeable shift in her patients' ages and attitudes in the last two decades. In the beginning, her patients tended to be older, in their early 40s and viewed egg freezing as a last-ditch procedure as they hedged the end of their reproductive lives. Now, women as young as their late 20s come in to see Noyes. Eyvazzadeh, who has also worked in the field for 20 years and lives in California, has noticed a trend towards younger patients who are choosing to freeze their eggs while they're at their most viable. This is the case for social media influencer Serena Kerrigan, who just recently turned 30. Despite being in a relationship, egg freezing was a procedure she willingly undertook while focusing on growing her business, she told CNBC. Kerrigan, who has more than 800,000 followers between her Instagram and TikTok and is based in New York, began sharing her egg freezing journey last year. She wanted to remove some of the stigma around egg freezing and give her followers an inside look at the arduous process. Kerrigan has paid for all her procedures on her own, she told CNBC, and recently partnered with her clinic, Spring Fertility, to donate a round of egg freezing to one of her followers. Eventually, she hopes egg freezing can be less stigmatized. ""There's a layer of shame or taboo that I actually don't understand. To me, this is science, and this is incredible, and this is a huge advancement,"" she said. ""This is a way of putting the power back into women and having control of their lives."" While the benefits of egg freezing are certainly enormous, so too are the associated costs. The average price for a single egg freezing cycle in the U.S. clocks in at Nutrition health coach Jenny Hayes Edwards froze her eggs in 2010 at 34 years old and was But high costs were her number one obstacle. Her restaurants had taken a hit after the 2008 financial collapse, when many consumers began foregoing their expensive ski vacations in Colorado. Hayes Edwards remembers it being a tough decision to make. But her mother eventually helped sway her in favor of the procedure. ""It's just money, and the opportunity that you might be missing is so much bigger,"" Hayes Edwards recalled her mother saying. ""I was so grateful that she pushed me over the edge."" She was able to scrape together the $15,000 needed through maxing out a credit card, selling some jewelry and liquidating a bond in her inheritance. Hayes Edwards now has a healthy three-year-old daughter, conceived nearly a decade after she froze her eggs, and is still appreciative for the extra time egg freezing bought her to meet her now-husband. In recent years, egg freezing, fertility and family planning services have increasingly Michelle Parsons decided to freeze her eggs since the procedure was offered through her job. The various tech companies Parsons has worked for have offered anywhere between $10,000 to $75,000 in fertility benefits. Parsons, who is a lesbian, had always known that she wanted to freeze her eggs — and undertook the procedure while working at Match Group as chief product officer of dating app Hinge. At the time, neither she nor her ex-partner were ready to have children, but it was one financial incentive Parsons didn't want to miss out on. Besides eggs, Parsons also chose to freeze her successfully fertilized embryos as another backup. Frozen embryos have a much higher likelihood of viable thawing. In fact, Parsons' search for a sperm donor sparked one of the most-used features on the Hinge app — voice prompts. ""When we started to listen to all of these voice recordings of potential sperm donors, the lightbulb went off in my head and I was like, wow, this is what's missing from dating right now,"" Parsons told CNBC. ""Because voice gives you so much nuance into personality, humor, vibe … we ended up building that feature called voice prompts on Hinge and it was a huge, wild success that led to rapid growth for Hinge and it became viral on TikTok."" Still, Parsons noticed egg freezing taking a toll on her professional and personal life in other ways. ""You have to inject yourself with hormones for two weeks. You have to eat differently. You don't really want to be in social settings. You can't drink. There are all these other ramifications around just going through that process, even though we know it'll be for this one month and then it'll be over,"" she said. The process also doesn't guarantee success. Evelyn Gosnell underwent her first egg retrieval when she was 32, following by two additional cycles at 36 and 38 years old. By the time she was ready to have children with her now-partner, the New York-based behavioral scientist had many frozen eggs ready. But, she received no viable and normal embryos after her eggs had been thawed and fertilized.

"Falling fertility rates are set to spark a transformational demographic shift over the next 25 years, with major implications for the global economy, according to a new study. By 2050, three-quarters of countries are forecast to fall below the population replacement birth rate of 2.1 babies per female, research That would leave 49 countries — primarily in low-income regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia — responsible for the majority of new births. ""Future trends in fertility rates and livebirths will propagate shifts in global population dynamics, driving changes to international relations and a geopolitical environment, and highlighting new challenges in migration and global aid networks,"" the report's authors wrote in their conclusion. By 2100, just six countries are expected to have population-replacing birth rates: The African nations of Chad, Niger and Tonga, the Pacific islands of Samoa and Tonga, and central Asia's Tajikistan. That shifting demographic landscape will have ""profound"" social, economic, environmental and geopolitical impacts, the report's authors said. In particular, shrinking workforces in advanced economies will require significant political and fiscal intervention, even as advances in technology provide some support. ""As the workforce declines, the total size of the economy will tend to decline even if output per worker stays the same. In the absence of liberal migration policies, these nations will face many challenges,"" Dr. Christopher Murray, a lead author of the report and director at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNBC. ""AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics may diminish the economic impact of declining workforces but some sectors such as housing would continue to be strongly affected,"" he added. The report, which was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, did not put a figure on the specific economic impact of the demographic shifts. However, it did highlight a divergence between high-income countries, where birth rates are steadily falling, and low-income countries, where they continue to rise. From 1950 to 2021, the global total fertility rate (TFR) — or average number of babies born to a woman — more than halved, falling from 4.84 to 2.23, as many countries grew wealthier and women had fewer babies. That trend was exacerbated by societal shifts, such as an increase in female workforce participation, and political measures including China's one-child policy. From 2050 to 2100, the total global fertility rate is set to fall further from 1.83 to 1.59. The replacement rate — or number of children a couple would need to have to replace themselves — That comes even as the global population is forecast to grow from 8 billion currently to 9.7 billion by 2050, before peaking at around 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s, Already, many advanced economies have fertility rates well below the replacement rate. By the middle of the century, that category is set to include major economies China and India, with South Korea's birth rate ranking as the lowest globally at 0.82 Meantime, lower-income countries are expected to see their share of new births almost double from 18% in 2021 to 35% by 2100. By the turn of the century, sub-Saharan Africa will account for half of all new births, according to the report. Murray said that this could put poorer countries in a ""stronger position"" to negotiate more ethical and fair migration policies — leverage that could become important as countries grow increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change.

"Stubbornly high inflation could push the Federal Reserve into a more cautious stance this year regarding interest rate cuts, the central bank's former vice chair said Friday. Richard Clarida, who served as Fed governor until January 2022 and is now a global economic advisor at asset management giant Pimco, said his former colleagues need to be on guard against sticky prices that could thwart plans to ease monetary policy this year. At its meeting earlier this week, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee indicated ""This may be more of a hope than a forecast,"" Clarida said during an interview on CNBC's "" Markets also are expecting three cuts this year, though that pricing has been scaled back after data to start the year showed inflation higher than expected. Fed officials are banking that elevated shelter inflation is on its way down, paving the way to lower their key borrowing rate from its highest level in more than 23 years. Clarida, however, said the extent to which the Fed can cut is unclear. ""Under a pretty broad range of scenarios, they're going to get at least one cut in this year,"" he said. However, the calculus gets different as inflation data provides mixed signals. The Fed prefers the Commerce Department's measure of personal consumption expenditures prices, with a particular focus on the core reading that excludes food and energy.

A ""What I think is going on here is a delicate balance that [Powell is] trying to navigate,"" Clarida said.

"Private sector job growth expanded in March at its fastest pace since July 2023, indicating continuing buoyance in the U.S. labor market, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. Companies added 184,000 workers on the month, an increase from the upwardly revised February gain of 155,000, which also was the Dow Jones estimate for March. In addition to the strong employment pickup, ADP reported that wages for workers who stayed in their jobs increased 5.1% from a year ago, the same rate as February after showing a steady easing going well back into 2023. Those switching jobs saw gains of 10%, also higher than in previous months. ""March was surprising not just for the pay gains, but the sectors that recorded them,"" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. ""Inflation has been cooling, but our data shows pay is heating up in both goods and services."" Job gains were fairly broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality with 63,000. Other sectors showing significant increases included construction (33,000), trade, transportation and utilities (29,000), and education and health services (17,000). Professional and business services saw a loss of 8,000. Services-related industries accounted for 142,000 of the total, with goods providing the rest. ADP, whose survey is based on payroll data analysis of more than 25 million workers, does not track government jobs. Most of the growth came from companies that employ more than 50 workers, with small businesses adding just 16,000 to the total. From a regional standpoint, the South saw the biggest gains, adding 91,000 workers. The ADP estimate serves as a precursor to the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls survey, set to be released Friday, though the numbers often diverge sharply.

"Turkey's annual inflation rose to 68.5% for the month of March, an increase on February's 67.1% inflation read, according to the The monthly rise in consumer prices came out at 3.16%, led by education, communication, and hotels, restaurants and cafes, which saw month-on-month rises of 13%, 5.6%, and 3.9%, respectively. On an annual basis, education again saw the highest cost inflation at 104% year on year, followed by hotels, restaurants and cafes at 95% and health at 80%. Turkey has launched a concerted effort to tackle soaring inflation with interest rate hikes, most recently raising the country's key rate from 45% to Much of the inflation in recent months stems from a significant Economists expect further rate increases from the central bank will be necessary. While the March inflation count represents ""the smallest monthly increase in three months and suggests that the impact of the large minimum wage hike in January may now have largely passed, it is still far from consistent with the single-digit inflation that policymakers are trying to achieve,"" Nicholas Farr, an emerging Europe economist at London-based Capital Economics, wrote in an analyst note Wednesday. ""The latest inflation figures do little to change our view that further monetary tightening lies in store and that a more concerted effort to tighten fiscal policy will be needed too,"" he said. Turkey's central bank implemented eight consecutive interest rate hikes from June 2023 to January 2024, totaling a cumulative 3,650 basis points. It paused in February, suggesting the tightening cycle was over, before raising rates again in March, citing ""deterioration in the inflation outlook"" and saying that ""tight monetary stance will be maintained until a significant and sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed."" Analysts note that with Economic pain and steep living cost increases for ordinary Turks over the last several years played a major role in the results, political observers said. Exercising tight control over the central bank, Erdogan for the last few years refused to raise rates, calling them ""the mother of all evil"" and insisting, against economic orthodoxy, that lowering rates was the way to cool inflation. This was despite declining foreign currency reserves and a rapidly weakening Only after appointing a new finance and central bank team in May 2023 did the central bank stage a turnaround in policy, suggesting greater independence at the bank from the executive branch of Turkey's government. But the political loss for Erdogan's party in the March local elections could make his future moves more unpredictable, some analysts say. ""The outcome of the vote fuels political uncertainty and raises doubts about whether President Recep Erdogan will stick to unpopular orthodox policies,"" Bartosz Sawicki, a market analyst at fintech firm Conotoxia, wrote in a note.

"The March nonfarm payrolls count likely will indicate hiring continuing at a solid pace, though some weakening foundations of the labor market could take greater focus when the Labor Department releases its key report Friday morning. Job growth is expected to come in at 200,000 for the period, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast. If that's correct, it will mark a slowdown from Yet a funny thing has been happening with the jobs reports recently: Initially strong numbers have tended to be lowered in subsequent estimates, raising questions about whether the jobs situation is as positive as it looks. That will be just one of several key areas in focus when the report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. February's release raised eyebrows with a gain that trounced the Wall Street outlook for 198,000 new jobs. Also gaining notice, though, were revisions to the prior two months that reduced December's count by 43,000 to 290,000 and January's by a whopping 124,000 to 229,000. For all of 2023, The trend ""makes me wonder about the credibility of the first number,"" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas. ""So I'll be looking for the revisions from the prior month to see if they're going to be knocked down, and most likely they will be. That's why if you get a big number, take it with a grain of salt."" There is some anticipation on Wall Street of an upside surprise: Goldman Sachs raised its initial forecast to 240,000, an increase of 25,000, following strong Along with numbers, composition is important, namely where the growth is coming from and whether there are any cracks in the employment armor. The job market's resilience has confounded many economists who spent the past two years searching for a jobs-led recession that never happened. ""Firms are seeing strong demand. They've dramatically increased their productivity, and so they're hiring for different kinds of jobs,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. ""That has enabled them to deal with the high-rate environment."" Still, there are areas of concern. Household employment, which counts individual workers rather than total jobs and is used to calculate the unemployment rate, has fallen by nearly 1 million since November. The survey is more volatile and uses a much smaller sample than the establishment count that yields the headline payrolls growth total. But there's no obvious reason for the weakness, though some economists speculate it could involve the surge in illegal immigration over the past few years. Also, Federal Reserve officials will watch all those factors for signs of inflation pressures. Stocks have been under pressure this week as investors worry about the direction of monetary policy. Average hourly earnings are projected to have increased 0.3% in March, which would be a jump from 0.1% in February, though the estimate for the annual gain is 4.1%, or 0.2 percentage point less. If the consensus calls are correct, it's unlikely to move the needle much for the Fed, which is expected to ""Unless there is a wildly positive or outright tragic employment report, they're going to stay on course,"" North said. ""They've been really clear recently pushing back on the market, saying we're in no big hurry, inflation is not down to 2%."" North said he expects the Fed to wait until July before it starts cutting rates — contrary to current market expectations. ",,2024-04-07,,Job gains expected again in March.

"The U.S. Federal Reserve has become too data dependent and has lost sight of its overall strategy, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said Friday. The economist told CNBC that a longer-term, more strategic outlook could see policymakers settle on a new inflation target of closer to 3%. ""Rather than be strategic, this Fed is overly data dependent, and has turned into a play-by-play commentator,"" El-Erian told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Spring Forum in Italy. ""That's not the role of the Fed,"" he continued. ""The Fed should be strategic, the Fed should provide a strategic anchor, a stabilizer."" ""The mistake that they may make is they'll end up this time being too tight,"" he said. The Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. El-Erian's comments follow a recent chorus of Fed policymakers who have begun speaking conservatively about rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the bank would need A day later, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he wondered if the central bank should El-Erian said the comments were an example of the Fed ""overreacting to data,"" and said that it should take a more holistic view of the economy. However, he noted that policymakers' hawkish approach could be an indication that they are considering the possibility of a new normal inflation target. ""The way you discuss it politely is you don't say 'let's change the inflation target,' you say 'let's get to 2% somewhere in the future. Let's have a trajectory,'"" El-Erian said. ""It may well prove that the economy is stable nearer to 3%. I don't think that's going to de-anchor inflation expectations,"" he added. In an effort to drag inflation back down toward its target, the Fed has hiked interest rates 11 times in total over the last few years to a target range of 5.25%-5.5% — the highest level for more than 22 years. The Fed's goal has proven especially challenging given the high volumes of U.S. banking reserves at present, according to Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. In past monetary tightening cycles, central banks have squeezed bank reserves as an additional means of lowering inflation. But with current U.S. reserves around 1,700 larger than before the 2008 Lehman crisis, according to Koo, that path was unviable. ""If you tried to tighten with this tool, you have to remove the $3.2 trillion first, before you will have any grip on the situation. And of course, you cannot do that overnight,"" Koo said at the same event Thursday. ""So much is on interest rates, and interest rates will have to go much higher to get the same effect it did have before excess reserves were at this magnitude,"" he added.

The core rate of inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, cooled from 3.1% to 2.9%, also coming in below expectations.

"The U.S. labor market surprised economists with its strength once again, Health care and social assistance were the top sector for job gains — a common theme in recent years — adding 81,300 jobs. Government and leisure and hospitality were the next two strongest sectors, and together these top groups accounted for more than 60% of March's gains. Within health care, ambulatory services and hospitals combined to add 55,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Local government was another strong subgroup for hiring, growing by 49,000 jobs. Notably, the leisure and hospitality sector is now back to its pre-pandemic employment level, according to the BLS. Employment in this area, which includes bars and restaurants, fell dramatically in 2020 when many such establishments were closed for health concerns. The continued rebound of these jobs, along with strong months for sectors like construction, could be a sign that immigration is helping the labor market grow without putting too much upward pressure on wages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the labor force participation has changed little in the past year despite consistent upside surprises for job gains. ""Last year, half of the growth in the labor force came from net immigration. There were 5.2 million additional jobs last year, thanks to net immigration. It's been the key to rebalancing the labor market. It's a huge part of the reason we've got the growth that we've got and the disinflation that we've had,"" Stony Brook University professor Stephanie Kelton said Friday on "" ",,2024-04-07,,Here's where the jobs are for March 2024 — in one chart
"New cars today are loaded with high-tech features for car shoppers, But with those advancements come questions about ""As much advancement as we have when it comes to new features, many of them are data dependent,"" he said, whether it's through a Almost every new vehicle collects different types of details about you — and they will share and sell that data, according to a More from Personal Finance: Most of the reviewed brands, 84%, share personal data with service providers, data brokers and other parties not named, the report found. About 76%, or 19 of the consulted brands, said they sell customer data to third parties. Only two car brands currently allow users to delete their personal data, Mozilla found: Renault and Dacia. ""This is still kind of the 'Wild, Wild West' of data collection and aggregation,"" said Theresa Payton, the founder, president and chief executive officer of Fortalice Solutions, a cybersecurity advisory firm. ""There are several challenges that remain in place for consumers,"" she said, as drivers try to find the best car that fits within their budgets and their own privacy concerns. To be sure, data collected by cars nowadays may not be too different from that shared from the ""cellphones already in our pocket,"" said Tom McParland, a contributing writer for automotive website Jalopnik and operator of vehicle-buying service Automatch Consulting. Said Drury: ""Think about how you use your phone. There's a lot of stuff that people don't realize that they've already given up when it comes to data."" While it remains to be difficult to do your own research, there are three steps car shoppers can take as they assess potential new cars, experts say. Once you narrow your options down to a specific vehicle, the first thing you can do is talk to the dealership and see what insight they can give you on that brand's data collection practices, experts say. You can ask representatives at the dealership about a carmaker's privacy policies and if you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of data collection, data aggregation and data monetization — or the selling of your data to third-party vendors, said Payton. Additionally, ask if you can be anonymized and not have the data aggregated under your name and your vehicle's unique identifying number, she said. People at the dealership ""might even point you towards talking to the service manager, who often has to deal with any repairs and any follow up and technical components,"" said Drury. ""Your service provider or the service adviser is actually going to have a little more insight versus the salesperson,"" he said. It may also be worthwhile to ask your auto insurance provider about car data collection, said Drury. Auto insurers may be receiving data of this nature as automakers share or sell it. While people at the dealership will have some knowledge on a specific vehicle, the insurance provider might give a better holistic view of it because they're covering many different makes and models, he said. ""I'd ask the insurance company, 'Are you using this and do you have an option to opt in or opt out different devices to monitor,'"" said Drury. These days, many newer vehicles essentially have an onboard computer. If you don't want to be tracked or have vehicle data collected and shared, you might find instructions in your owner's manual on how to wipe out your personalized data and information from the onboard computer, said Payton. ""That can be a great way if you are already in a car and you love the car, but you don't like the data tracking,"" she said. While you may not know if the data was already collected and sent out to third parties, you could do this on a periodic basis, she said. Some separate online tools might also help: An online resource called Privacy4Cars can help users delete personal data stored by automakers, including text messages and geolocations, Payton said. ""They are providing this tool to help users understand the data their cars collect and to give them an option to safeguard their privacy,"" she said. In a recent episode from The New York Times' ""The Daily"" podcast, a woman paid a mechanic $400 to remove the device in her vehicle that provided internet connectivity. She essentially While it may be possible to isolate and remove a car part or chip like this, you can't just rip out a CPU of a car, said McParland. ""Almost everything nowadays is going to have these integrated systems,"" he said. Drury agreed: ""These systems are so integrated with everything that your vehicle's doing. [The] sensors ... that help with [a] vehicle's semi-autonomous features, those are wired to your throttle, to your steering, to your breaks. It can be extremely dangerous for somebody to go around there and start unplugging things."" Drivers can always tap into the older, used car market to find a vehicle without high-tech features, but such cars might have their own risks the older they are, said McParland. Additionally, the car's onboard computer can provide a lot of safety features like car alerts, said Payton: ""If you were to ostensibly turn off the onboard computer, you might miss out. It's finding that right balance, it's a risk versus reward."" ",,2024-04-07,,"As new vehicles become more like computers, what car shoppers need to know about protecting their data"

"In this article It's a timeless question at fast-food counters: Do you want fries with that? Responders continue answering affirmatively at a higher-than-average rate, a top potato supplier indicated. It underscores the resilience of consumer spending, even as inflation pinches pocketbooks and pandemic savings dry up. A larger share of customers ""The fry attachment rate has stayed pretty consistent,"" said CEO Thomas Werner during the company's earnings call on Thursday. ""It's been above historical levels for the past two, three years."" This is just one example of how consumers keep purchasing despite mounting reasons to tighten purse strings, a phenomenon that's puzzling economists. Spending on retail and food services in America topped $700 billion in February, according to Rising wages and fiscal stimulus measures padded bank accounts during the early years of the Covid-19 crisis, prompting increased purchasing.

"When it comes to One key theme, overspending, tends to crop up, whether it be on For one pair of clients, realizing how much they had spent in the past 18 months on jewelry — $1.4 million — was a shock, said Barry Glassman, a certified financial planner and founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services in Vienna, Virginia. The following year, after meeting with Glassman, they pared those outlays down to about $8,800, which went mostly to jewelry repairs. ""When people see where their money is going, their behavior changes,"" said Glassman, who is a member of The ultra-high-net worth clients' spending is out of reach for most consumers. But the temptation to overspend can affect everyone, no matter their income. ""At the extreme, this is why most lottery winners go bankrupt,"" Glassman said. ""They feel like they've made it, they feel wealthy,"" he said. ""But they don't realize the difference between wealth and income."" Not all discretionary spending is negative, particularly if it is intentional and aligns with your goals, notes Preston Cherry, a CFP, founder and president of ""There shouldn't be social shame in spending to fund your well-being, present or future,"" said Cherry, who is also a CNBC FA Council member. But Glassman, Cherry and other experts on the council say there are certain risks that can damage your bottom line and put your ability to achieve other goals at risk. When it comes to splurges on big-ticket items, Louis Barajas, a CFP, enrolled agent and CEO of ""This is a work on mindset over budget,"" said Barajas, a CNBC FA Council member. One big-ticket purchase, buying a home, can set people back if they take on too much house or too big of a mortgage, notes CNBC FA Council member Cathy Curtis, a CFP and the founder and CEO of One family Curtis worked with missed out on a few houses by bidding too low. To correct that, they took their realtor's advice to bid high on the next house they found. Curtis' spreadsheets and advice on how much they could afford ""went right out the window,"" she said. The family's house payment, combined with property taxes and insurance, put them at risk for a cash crunch. They reached a low point when the husband lost his job, which prompted the wife to spend down her inheritance. Taking such risks on real estate can be a gamble. While homebuyers may grow into their payments with salary increases, that doesn't always work out, Curtis said. The silver lining is that most real estate tends to appreciate over time, and therefore can be a good investment, she said. When shopping for a home, it is better to treat it as a business decision rather than a personal one, Curtis advised. ""Buying a house can be a very emotional experience,"" Curtis said. ""I advise clients to keep their emotions in check and know that there will always be another house that is a better fit."" Another big-ticket purchase, a college education, may also require keeping emotions in check, particularly if a child's dream school will break the bank. ""Your kids can always borrow money for their college degree, but you can't borrow for your retirement,"" said CNBC FA Council member Ted Jenkin, a CFP and the CEO and founder of Jenkin said he tells clients to prioritize their retirement savings first, and to cut college savings if they are behind on that goal. Smaller purchases can have a sneaky way of adding up over time. When Glassman has his clients do an analysis of their spending, many find they are shocked how their dining-out habits add up. The same may apply to other categories, such as gifts or travel, he said. ""From there, 99% of the time, behavior changes,"" Glassman said, prompted by the realization that small adjustments, such as eating in one time per month or per week, can make a big difference. Assessing just how much is reasonable to spend is a lifelong endeavor, and often a tricky one in retirement. Some retirees may spend too much when they first retire, and be tempted to provide other family members with financial support, notes CNBC FA Council member Ivory Johnson, a CFP and the founder of ""I have had to tell clients to put their family on a budget because I understand the impact it'll have on their retirement,"" Johnson said. Not everyone is susceptible to overspending. For those who are instead prone to saving, drawing from their nest egg can feel uncomfortable once they reach retirement. ""It is challenging to shift from the good saving and investing habits that lead to a secure retirement to spending down assets,"" said CNBC FA Council member For investors who can afford to spend more, that can be a missed opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labor, through gifts to family, travel or donations to causes important to them, she said. Working with a financial advisor can help individuals assess whether their spending is too much, too little or just right. You can also do a gut check on your own by gauging your mindfulness with your money, Cherry suggests. ""Intentional spending within a plan that invests in your wellbeing is perfectly OK,"" Cherry said.

"Job creation in March easily topped expectations in a sign of continued acceleration for what has been a bustling and resilient labor market. Nonfarm payrolls increased 303,000 for the month, well above the Dow Jones estimate for a rise of 200,000 and higher than the downwardly revised 270,000 gain in February, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%, as expected, even though the labor force participation rate moved higher to 62.7%, a gain of 0.2 percentage point from February. A broader measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons held steady at 7.3%. In the key average hourly earnings measure, wages rose 0.3% for the month and 4.1% from a year ago, both in line with Wall Street estimates. Growth came from many of the usual sectors that have powered gains in recent months. Health care led with 72,000, followed by government (71,000), leisure and hospitality (49,000), and construction (39,000). Retail trade contributed 18,000 while the ""other services"" category added 16,000. The February revision was just 5,000 lower while the January revision brought that total up by 27,000 to 256,000, still well below the ""This is another really strong report,"" said Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments. ""This report and the February report showed some broadening in terms of job creation, which is a very good sign."" Despite the move lower in the broader unemployment level, the rate for Black people surged to 6.4%, a gain of 0.8 percentage point, tying the highest level since August 2022. Rates for Asians and Hispanics both fell sharply to 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively. A string of positive gains has kept unemployment below 4% since January 2022, though there have been some signs of cracks. For instance the level of household employment had grown only modestly over the past year, while temporary employment has declined sharply. However, the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, posted an even more robust gain in March, up 498,000, more than absorbing the 469,000 increase in the civilian labor force level. Gains tilted heavily to part-time workers in the household survey. Full-time workers fell by 6,000, while part-timers increased by 691,000. Multiple job holders rose by 217,000, to 5.2% of the total employment level. Markets have been keeping close watch over the employment data particularly as the Federal Reserve weighs its next moves on monetary policy. Stocks have tumbled this week amid concerns that a strong labor market and resilient economy could keep the central bank on hold for longer than expected. Stock market futures rose following the report while Treasury yields also added to gains. The Fed is looking to guide inflation back down to 2% annually, a goal that has proven elusive even as the rate of price gains has decelerated from its peak in mid-2022. Most measures have inflation running above 3%, though the Fed's preferred gauge is below that level. Market pricing is pointing toward the first interest rate cut coming in June, though several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, this week indicated they prefer to take a cautious data-dependent approach.

"Americans hate to However, reframing the concept can yield more positive results, experts said. They ""cringe"" at the word budgeting, said Winnie Sun, co-founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California. ""It's sort of like telling someone they need to diet and eat healthy,"" said Sun, a member of CNBC's About 68% of consumers say a budget would help them reach their personal and family goals, yet 40% say they have never had a budget, according to a Sun estimates more than 60% of her clients ""feel as if they're literally going to suffer"" if Sun mentions budgeting. Conversations around budgeting are generally distilled into two camps: spending on needs (i.e., essential items) and wants (nonessential items). This framework is meant to help weigh one's financial priorities, thereby keeping spending in check, But the exercise can turn budgeting into a feeling of deprivation — and people rebel as a result. The classic financial advice of slashing spending on wants such as entertainment, social connection, dating and education, for example, is at odds with ""the natural process of human motivation,"" Newcomb wrote. ""Yes, the numbers must work, but your life must work, too,"" she wrote. ""Otherwise, you'll internally resist your budget, and we all know how that can play out."" Financial experts recommend reframing the budgeting concept as a positive rather than a negative. For example, households can think of it as ""raising funds"" instead of cutting spending, Sun said. They can also establish financial goals. For example, what do they want to do with their extra funds? That may be paying down debt, saving for the long term or growing a pot of money for shorter-term goals such as a vacation, Sun said. ""We let the goals lead the act of budgeting,"" she said. ""For me, a budget is not about restricting myself,"" Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, a personal finance expert known as the Money Coach, Similarly, Newcomb recommends identifying new strategies that can meet one's needs and simultaneously save money. Newcomb gives the real-life example of a husband and wife who argued about how much money he spends on his boat each year. His needs are about self-actualization: He enjoys the wind in his hair and the sun on his face. She seeks safety and security, which are also important to her quality of life. Here, the husband found a new strategy: offering sailing lessons to teens at his yacht club, which helped offset the cost of his boat and allowed his wife to funnel that additional income into savings. There are other easy ways households can find extra money without sacrificing much, Sun said. For example, households with more than one streaming service can opt to use one service for six months then change to another for the next six months, decreasing their streaming budget by 50%, she said. Households with an ample emergency fund intact can consider shopping for auto and other insurance policies with a higher deductible than their current policy, likely lowering monthly premiums, Sun said. In the event of an insurance claim, the emergency fund can meet the deductible, she said. They can also commit to doing curbside pickup when shopping for groceries, for example. Shoppers make purchases more mindfully and avoid in-store impulse buying, Sun said. She finds clients generally save 20% to 25% or more on their groceries this way. Any additional cash flow can immediately be used to pay down debt, or go into long-term savings or toward a short-term goal, she said. Ultimately, if there is a money issue, she challenges clients to decrease their spending by 5% to 10% during the month. After each week of success, she encourages them to celebrate by making memories instead of debt: perhaps by doing something with friends, or hanging out at a park, beach or someone's backyard. ""You have to have a joy to replace that negative,"" she said. ",,2024-04-07,,People hate budgeting. Here’s why — and how to reframe it
"Social Security beneficiaries who owe money to the Social Security Administration may see much lower default withholding rates from their monthly checks, thanks to As of March 25, the Social Security Administration Instead, the agency will collect either 10% of a beneficiary's total monthly benefit or $10 — whichever is greater. But there may be a short period where beneficiaries are still affected by the old policy, the agency announced Friday. If that happens, affected beneficiaries should call the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213 More from Personal Finance: The new rules apply to overpayments, which are triggered when the amount of benefits due is miscalculated and checks are sent for higher sums than what beneficiaries are owed. When that happens, the Social Security Administration is required by law to seek repayment of the excess money paid to beneficiaries. But it might not be clear that an overpayment has happened for years, sometimes resulting in overpayment notices for tens of thousands of dollars. In recent years, the problem with overpayments has become worse, said David Camp, CEO at the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives. ""There were always far too many overpayments,"" Camp said, as the agency has struggled over the years with limited or outdated resources. ""Although in the last few years, it's been a steady, though shockingly high, sum total of overpaid individuals."" Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, beneficiaries who face strict limits on their income and assets are particularly vulnerable to overpayment issues, Camp said. The Social Security Administration said it is working to curb the burden to affected beneficiaries. ""We are no longer going to have that clawback cruelty of intercepting 100% of a payment if people do not respond to our notice,"" Commissioner Martin O'Malley said during recent testimony before the Senate. While the new repayment threshold applies to new overpayments, beneficiaries who currently have an overpayment withholding rate greater than 10% can contact the Social Security Administration to have that lowered, the agency said. All affected beneficiaries should call the agency about the 10% repayment rate, Camp said, but they need to approach the process with patience. The Social Security Administration does not have enough staff to answer a high volume of calls, so beneficiaries should expect a hold time, Camp said, as well as processing time. The Social Security Administration is also implementing other new policies to address overpayments, including shifting the burden of proof away from Social Security claimants when determining who is at fault for the error. The maximum time for repayment plans is being extended to 60 months, up from 36 months. It will also be easier for beneficiaries to request a waiver so they don't have to pay back the sums. ""The great majority of claimants never request a waiver, although many of them could qualify,"" Camp said. That's particularly true for beneficiaries who are struggling to meet their basic needs or who are at risk of being evicted because they are repaying Social Security, he said. ""Claimants ought to know that they can also ask for not having to pay it back at all if it wasn't their fault and they can't afford to repay,"" Camp said. To request a waiver, a beneficiary must Since O'Malley was sworn in as commissioner in December, he has taken some ""very aggressive steps"" toward addressing the overpayment issues that vex beneficiaries, said Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. ""They're so reasonable, it makes you wonder why no one did it before,"" said Richtman, referring especially to the end of the policy of withholding all of a beneficiary's monthly payments until the entire overpaid sum is repaid. ""That's a huge burden on most beneficiaries who live on Social Security or the majority of their income is Social Security,"" Richtman said.

"The unemployment rate among Black Americans jumped in March, according to data released Friday Black unemployment rose to 6.4% last month, up from 5.6% in February. That's higher than the overall unemployment rate, which When accounting for gender, the unemployment rate for Black women aged 20 or older spiked to 5.6%, a big increase from the 4.4% rate in February. Black men's jobless rates climbed slightly higher to 6.2% from 6.1%. ""That's a concerning trend,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Gould pointed out that the unemployment rate for Black Americans has been steadily increasing since December. ""I would say it's not alarming yet, but I think it's something that we really need to watch in coming months,"" she added. While March's increase was primarily driven by the surge among Black women, Gould noted that in the past four months, the unemployment rates for both men and women has risen. However, she also cautioned that monthly data for demographic groups can be volatile by nature. Last month, the labor force participation rate – the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work – among Black Americans inched lower to 63.6%, down from 63.7% in February.  For Black women, the rate ticked lower to 63% from 63.4%, while it inched down to 69.6% from 69.8% among Black men. ""People are looking for more opportunities, not all of them are getting them, and that's why the unemployment rate is rising,"" Gould added. This compares to the overall U.S. labor market participation rate, which rose to 62.7% in March from February's 62.5%. Black Americans were the demographic group that suffered the most from Covid-induced business shutdowns. The unemployment rate for Black workers Hispanic Americans saw their unemployment rate drop to 4.5% from 5% last month.

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel.

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""982962b8-f01f-4029-9baa-c43aba0a0a5a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""333"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient. Yet, <a href=""https://thrivenfunctionalmedicine.com/vitamin-d/#:~:text=Optimal%20levels%20of%20Vitamin%20D,the%20patient%20is%20severely%20deficient."">many functional health practitioners</a> advocate for an optimal range of 50–80 ng/mL.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations according to the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">National Institutes for Health</a> (NIH):</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""53373662-c9f2-496d-92b1-d9bb923a8a68"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""213"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-19-12.jpg?itok=QY09R5_u"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

"Housing costs are outpacing median household incomes in the U.S., further straining affordability. Would-be homebuyers need to earn $113,520 a year to afford the typical house in the U.S. That is 35% more than what the typical household earns annually, which is $84,072, according to a ""Since the pandemic, affordability has just totally collapsed,"" said Chen Zhao, a senior economist at Redfin. February 2021 was the last month when the typical household earned more money than it needed to afford the median home. There's been a deficit ever since, Zhao said. More from Personal Finance: ""That deficit hit a peak in October of 2023,"" she added. ""The reason why it hit a peak then is because that's when mortgage rates peaked as well."" Meanwhile, home prices also remained high because of an inventory crunch: the median sale price for a house was $412,778 in February 2024, according to Redfin. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, The average household fell short $29,448 to afford a home in February, The affordability deficit narrowed because mortgage rates have been on a consistent decline since the last peak in October, according to Zhao. At that peak, the average 30-year fixed ""It's been a pretty big change since last October,"" Zhao said. Other reasons such as seasonal pricing may be reflected, as home prices tend to decline in the winter months, said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. However, potential buyers are still on the sidelines, said Veronica Fuentes, a certified financial planner at Northwestern Mutual. ""They're either holding off or they're taking their time,"" she said. Recent layoffs in the technology industry have affected some of her clients' attitudes, Fuentes said. While her clients may not be on the chopping block, seeing their co-workers get laid off has made many of them more cautious. ""If you were laid off, could you still afford this mortgage? Do you have six months [of] emergency savings or even a year [of] emergency savings? ... Can you still afford the mortgage for six months if you have no job?"" Fuentes said. In a time when a potential buyer needs to earn about $114,000 a year to afford a median-priced house in the U.S., a starter home would make the most sense for price-sensitive buyers, experts say. A potential buyer should make about $76,000 a year to afford a Starter homes are hard to come by. Home builders over the past 15 years or so have moved away from building entry-level homes, said Ostrowski. For almost the entire second half of the 20th century, someone could buy a home for $120,000 in many parts of the U.S., he said. ""That just doesn't exist anymore,"" Ostrowski said. Buyers could seek lower costs in certain markets in the U.S. There are 13 metropolitan areas where buyers might afford the typical home without earning six figures, Redfin found. In Detroit, the typical household needed to earn $46,168 to afford the median-priced home in February, making it the most affordable market in the country. It was followed by Cleveland ($58,186), Pittsburgh ($61,603), St. Louis ($66,755) and Philadelphia ($73,182).

Hensley, president and CEO of the National Endowment for Financial Education, or NEFE. ""That goes a long way to relieving stress."" Among U.S. respondents in the CNBC survey, some of the most common components to feeling financially secure included having no outstanding debts (59%), accumulating ""high levels"" of savings (47%) and owning their own home (45%). When it comes to achieving that security, 44% of U.S. respondents said the most important part is spending less than you make, followed by 29% who point to having a steady, Just understanding that financial security is a highly personal goal — and one that doesn't necessarily require significant income or assets — can help you feel more secure, said Levine.

"The stock market could hit a milestone if the Dow Jones Industrial Average However, even as stocks have climbed higher, investors are worried there could be a pullback, financial advisors say. They're not alone in those concerns. A ""It does feel like we're at an inflection point where things could go either way,"" said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. After a mostly uninterrupted market rally over the past four or five months, it would not be surprising to see a pullback, said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. That would more likely come in the form of a temporary correction rather than a prolonged bear market, he said. For investors who have gravitated toward cash, certificates of deposit, or bonds, a pullback may be an opportunity to deploy those funds in the market, Kourkafas said. If you're investing toward your retirement or other life goals, it's best to avoid trying to time the market, said Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and the CEO and founder of ""The stock market is a long-term investment,"" said Jenkin, who is also a member of Investors are jittery that the presidential election results may throw the markets off track, But experts say those worries are misguided. ""It is really very hard to find any evidence in the data that politics is a long-term determinant of market performance,"" Kourkafas said. However, there may be increased volatility in the months preceding the election, he said. What's unique this time around is we are already familiar with both of the likely candidates — current President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump — and the markets have performed equally well under both leaders, he said. Instead, the outlook may depend more on other factors such as interest rates, corporate earnings and economic growth, he said. Financial advisors including Louis Barajas, a CFP and enrolled agent, said their clients are concerned the election may affect their portfolios. ""I tell them, 'Listen, presidents come, presidents go, the economy's going to change. But in the long term, the market tends to be up,'"" said Barajas, who is CEO of Barajas said he steers his clients to focus on their personal goals rather than on outside events. Today's market uncertainty is a reminder of the value of humility, said Morningstar's Benz. And the best way to express humility in portfolios is to diversify, she said. ""No matter what happens, we're reasonably well protected,"" Benz said. For young investors, that may mean moving away from U.S. stocks to non-U.S. holdings, she said. That may be done through a fund that reflects global market capitalization, such as the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF. Older investors may want to take advantage of higher fixed-income yields and add safer assets to their portfolios, she said. That can include cash and short- and intermediate-term high-quality bonds to build a runway to spend from, even if stocks do go down. ""You can have a safer portfolio and expect to earn a decent rate of return today,"" Benz said. If you're already in retirement and spending from your portfolio, it's worth having those safeguards in place. Finding the right mix of assets will depend on your personal timeline. For financial goals that aren't at least five years away, it makes no sense to invest in the stock market, Jenkin said. To test your own portfolio allocation based on your age, Jenkin suggested following the rule of 120 – subtract your age from that number to find out how you should be invested. So if you're 60 years old, for example, a 60% allocation to stocks may make sense. When it comes to revisiting your portfolio allocations, it's wise to set your own schedule rather than react to market or other news events. ""Make a plan to do that once a year or so,"" Benz said.

"The Despite its smaller scope than President Biden is planning to provide details of his new debt forgiveness plan during a speech Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

"There's a student loan forgiveness opportunity available to many borrowers, but they'll have to act by April 30 to qualify, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The U.S. Department of Education is conducting a one-time adjustment of borrowers' payments this summer, and those who ""The one-time adjustment is designed to count more of the payments you made, so they can be added to the payments required for cancellation,"" the CFPB says. Here's what to know. Income-driven repayment plans, Borrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan. One complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. ""They get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,"" he said. That can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans. More from Personal Finance: Now, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle. This could be a good deal for many, experts say. For example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness. Consolidating could lead them to immediately qualify for forgiveness on all of those loans, experts say, even though they'd normally need to wait at least another 14 years for full relief. Usually, a student loan consolidation restarts a borrowers' forgiveness timeline, making it a terrible move for those working toward cancellation. But the Biden administration has changed that program detail through April 30. All federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loans, Parent Plus loans and Perkins Loans, Kantrowitz said. You can apply for a ""So long as the application is submitted by April 30, they should be fine, even if the servicers take longer to process it,"" Kantrowitz said. Some borrowers who took out small amounts may even be eligible for cancellation after as few as 10 years' worth of payments, if they enroll in the new income-driven repayment option, known as the Consolidating your loans shouldn't increase your monthly payment, since your bill under an income-driven repayment plan is based on your earnings and not your total debt, Kantrowitz said. The new interest rate will be a weighted average of the rates across your loans. Before consolidating, it may be a good idea to get a complete payment history of each loan, so that you can later make sure you're getting the full credit you're entitled to, said You should be able to get a history of your payments at The payment history counts when your loans first entered repayment, not when the loan was borrowed, Rubin said. If a borrower believes there is an issue with their payment count, they can talk to their loan servicer or submit a complaint with the Department of Education's You should never have to pay a fee to consolidate your loan, the CFPB says.

The idea was it made it easier to launch an ETF, but it didn't make it easy,"" Sachs said. ""At one point, we had more than 41 clients that had called us with exactly the same problem: 'How do I do this, how do I move quickly and can you help us?'"" It can still take years to build the expertise, headcount and risk management framework necessary to launch an ETF, said Sachs. That is where Goldman's accelerator platform aims to help. ""[It] allows our clients to come in, launch, list and manage their own ETF — but do it off of the technology, infrastructure and risk management expertise that Goldman's known for and essentially get to market faster and cheaper than they could do it on their own,"" Sachs said.

"UBS on Tuesday announced a new share repurchase program of up to $2 billion, with up to $1 billion of that total expected to take place this year. ""As previously communicated, in 2024 we expect to repurchase up to USD 1bn of our shares, commencing after the completion of the merger of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG which is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Our ambition is for share repurchases to exceed our pre-acquisition level by 2026."" The new program follows the completion of the 2022 buyback, during which 298.5 million of it shares were purchased. This represented 8.62% of its stock worth $5.2 billion, according to UBS. The bank's 2022 share repurchase program concluded last month. Buybacks take place when firms purchase their own shares on the stock exchange, reducing the portion of shares in the hands of investors. They offer a way for companies to return cash to shareholders — along with dividends — and usually coincide with a company's stock moving higher, as shares get scarcer.

"Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Tuesday she still expects interest rate cuts this year, but ruled out the next policy meeting in May. Mester also indicated that the long-run path is higher than policymakers had previously thought. Her fellow policymaker, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, also said Tuesday she expects cuts this year but not until there's more convincing evidence that inflation has been subdued. The central bank official noted progress made on inflation while the economy has continued to grow. Should that continue, rate cuts are likely, though she didn't offer any guidance on timing or extent. ""I continue to think that the most likely scenario is that inflation will continue on its downward trajectory to 2 percent over time. But I need to see more data to raise my confidence,"" Mester said in prepared remarks for a speech in Cleveland. Additional inflation readings will provide clues as to whether some higher-than-expected data points this year either were temporary blips or a sign that the progress on inflation ""is stalling out,"" she added. ""I do not expect I will have enough information by the time of the FOMC's next meeting to make that determination,"" Mester said. Those remarks come nearly two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to Mester's comments would seem to rule out a cut at the April 30-May 1 FOMC meeting, a sentiment also reflected in market pricing. Mester is a voting member of the FOMC but will leave in June after having served the 10-year limit. Futures traders expect the Fed to start easing in June and to cut by three-quarters of a percentage point by the end of the year. San Francisco Fed President Daly said that three reductions this year is a ""very reasonable baseline"" though she said nothing is guaranteed. Daly also is an FOMC voter this year. ""Three rate cuts is a projection, and a projection is not a promise,"" she said, later adding, ""We're getting there, but it's not going to be tomorrow, but it's not going to be forever."" While looking for rate cuts, Mester said she thinks the long-run federal funds rate will be higher than the long-standing expectation of 2.5%. The rate is considered the level where policy is neither restrictive nor stimulative. After the March meeting, the long-rate rate projection moved up to 2.6%, indicating there are other members leaning higher. Mester noted the rate was very low when the Covid pandemic hit and gave the Fed little wiggle room to boost the economy. ""At this point, we are seeking to calibrate our policy well to economic developments so we can avoid having to act in an aggressive fashion,"" she said.

"The annual two-day ""SEC Speaks"" event kicked off Tuesday, offering clues to what the priorities will be for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming year. Sponsored by the Practising Law Institute, it is a forum where the SEC provides guidance to the legal community on rules, regulations, enforcement actions and lawsuits. The event allows the SEC to get its main messages across, and this year a key issue is ""disclosure."" ""[W]e have an obligation to update the rules of the road, always with an eye toward promoting trust as well as efficiency, competition, and liquidity in the markets,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in his introduction to the conference. Besides Gensler, all the SEC division heads and senior staff will be speaking. Based on Gensler's introductory remarks, there will be discussions about the upcoming move to shorten the securities settlement cycle from two days to one (T+1, which takes place May 28), the expansion of the definition of an exchange to include more recent trading platforms (like request-for-quote, or RFQ, electronic trading platforms), consideration of a change in the current one-penny increment for quoting stock trades to sub-penny levels, creation of a best execution standard for broker-dealers, and creation of more competition for individual investors orders (so-called payment for order flow). You often hear SEC officials say the role of the SEC is to ""protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation."" That sounds like a pretty broad mandate, and it is. Deliberately so. It came out of the disaster of the 1929 stock market crash, which was the initial event in the greatest economic catastrophe of the last 100 years: the Great Depression. Prior to 1933, and particularly in the 1920s, all sorts of securities were sold to the public with wild claims behind them, much of which were fraudulent. After the crash of 1929, Congress went looking for a cause, and fraudulent claims and lack of disclosure were high on the list. Congress then passed the Securities Act of 1933, and the following year passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC to enforce all the new laws. It also required everyone involved in the securities business (mainly brokerage firms and stock exchanges) to register with the SEC. The 1933 Act did not make it illegal to sell a bad investment. It simply required disclosure: all relevant facts about an investment were supposed to be disclosed, and investors could make up their own minds. The 1933 Act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities in the United States. This was followed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulated mutual funds (and eventually ETFs), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which required investment advisers to register with the SEC. Tuesday's conference is a chance for Gensler and his staff to tell everyone what they are doing in greater detail. The agency has six divisions, but they can be boiled down to disclosure, risk monitoring and enforcement. Risk monitoring. Disclosure. There's also a division of examinations that conducts the SEC's National Exam Program. It's just what it sounds like. The SEC identifies areas of high concern (cybersecurity, crypto, money laundering, climate change, etc.) and then monitors Corporate America (investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, etc.) to make sure they are in compliance with all the required disclosures. Current hot topics include climate change, crypto and cybersecurity. The problem is that the definition of what should be disclosed has evolved over the decades. For example, there is a bitter legal fight brewing over the recent enactment of regulations requiring companies to disclose climate risks. Many contend this was not part of the original SEC mandate. The SEC disagrees, arguing it is part of the mandate to ""protect investors."" Enforcement. These are the cops. They conduct investigations into securities laws violations, and they prosecute the civil suits in the federal courts. This division will be providing an update on the litigation the SEC is involved in, which is growing. Mutual funds, ETFs and investment advisers. Trading. Donald Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the SEC in January considerably tightened the rules around disclosure of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Trump's company, Truth Social, went public on March 22 through a merger with a SPAC known as Digital World Acquisition Corp. It is now trading as Prior to the recent rule changes, executives marketing a company to be acquired by a SPAC often made wild claims about the future profitability of these businesses — claims that would never have been possible to make had a traditional initial public offering route been used. The new SPAC rules that the SEC adopted made the target company legally liable for any statement made about future results by assuming responsibility for disclosures. Additionally, companies are provided with a ""safe harbor"" protection when they make forward-looking statements, which provide them with protection against certain legal liabilities. However, IPOs are not afforded this ""safe harbor"" protection, which is why forward-looking statements in an IPO registration are usually very cautiously worded. The rules clarified that SPACs also do not have ""safe harbor"" legal protections for forward-looking statements, which means the companies could more easily be sued. Like I said, Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the message: ""Disclosure!"" will likely be the dominant refrain.

<p><em><strong>It never ceases to amaze me at how little so many people in this country have done to train their minds to critically analyze information. </strong>They have eyes to see and ears to see, and yet, somehow the truth of any major issue still seems to evade them, or they simply refuse to recognize the truth with it standing right in front of them, slapping them in the face.</em></p>

<p><em>So many things are currently plumb damned fouled up by this Biden regime and going awry on their own through the dynamics <strong>set in motion by this anti-American, lawless regime</strong>, that it’s nearly impossible to properly address them all in a single commentary.

<p><em>Michael Savage, a longtime renown radio host, was fond of noting that <strong>“liberalism is a mental disorder” and we’re witnessing the result of its heavy utilization for far too many years without being grounded in common sense and a certain amount of pragmatic realism.</strong> And so here we are, on the cusp of the final fall of America, short of a miracle from God or true patriots taking a firm stand with rifles in hand and refusing to give an inch of ground and any further movement towards the new world order desired by our amerikkan commies.</em></p>

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The ability to dissem­inate large-scale disinformation to undermine scientifically established facts poses an exis­tential risk to humanity (A/75/982, para. 26) and endangers democratic institutions and funda­mental human rights. These risks have further in­tensified because of rapid advancements in tech­nology, such as generative artificial intelligence. Across the world, the United Nations is monitor­ing how mis- and disinformation and hate speech can threaten progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. It has become clear that business as usual is not an option.”</em></p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

<ol><li>
	<p>Climate change is happening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is caused by human activity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scientists agree that humans are responsible for climate change.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every fraction of a degree of warming matters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The climate is changing faster than humans, plants, and animals can adapt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Climate change is a major threat to people’s health.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel, not a clean source of energy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean energy technologies produce far less carbon pollution than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Entire countries already rely 100 percent on renewable electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy will soon be the world’s top source of electricity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Solar panels and wind turbines make good use of land.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs.</p>
	</li>
</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

<p>Verified is backed by powerful globalist NGOs including the Rockefeller Foundation and Omidyar Network. It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<h2>COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE OR ADVOCATING SUPPRESSION?</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/"">recently released report</a> issued by the <a href=""https://counterhate.com/"">Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH)</a> claims that new forms of climate denial have emerged. These new arguments don’t deny that the climate is changing and is caused by human activity, but instead contend that:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><em>The impacts of global warming are beneficial or harmless.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate solutions won’t work.</em></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Climate science and the climate movement are unreliable.</em></p>
	</li>
</ul><p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""ee887cbb-84d7-4d3d-af12-9d7c3734e24a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""645"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_11-50-25.jpg?itok=S2Urkous"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Image: The New Climate Denial Report, Page 40</em></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<p>If one dares to publicly question the science regarding climate change, one or more of the following tactics may be used to impede the effort:</p>

</ul><p>Each of these organizations are fueled and funded by many of the entities responsible for advancing the climate agenda, especially as it relates to the UN SDGs. This globalized amalgamation of media watchdogs, fact checkers, and disinformation regulators is powered by billion-dollar corporations, democratic and undemocratic governments, influential foundations, and powerful NGOs. The list includes <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/21/fact-sheet-prioritizing-climate-in-foreign-policy-and-national-security/"">The White House</a>, <a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/2820047/state-department-disinformation-tracker-gdi-redacts-tax-forms/"">U.S. State Department</a>, <a href=""https://foundationforfreedomonline.com/newsguard-strategy-revealed-financial-throttling-virality/"">U.S. Department of Defense</a>, <a href=""https://reason.com/2022/10/31/dhs-still-policing-disinformation-despite-dissolving-disinformation-governance-board/"">U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/fbi-colluded-twitter-suppress-free-speech-where-outrage-opinion-1768801"">Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)</a>, <a href=""https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/NSF-Staff-Report_Appendix.pdf"">The National Science Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://shareverified.com/about/"">United Nations</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/major-funders/"">Poynter Institute</a>, <a href=""https://www.ned.org/"">National Endowment for Democracy</a>, <a href=""https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2017/largest-funders-of-the-poynter-institute/"">Open Society Foundations</a>, <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/13-million-in-grants-from-omidyar-network-open-society-foundations-will-expand-poynters-international-fact-checking-network-300481553.html"">Omidyar Network</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-obsessed-ap-blames-humanity-for-hellish-summer-of-earths-discontent/"">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/billionaire-fueled-rockefeller-fund-coordinated-climate-lawsuits-with-dem-state-ag-docs-show/"">Rockefeller Family Fund</a>, <a href=""https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2015/11/opp1138320"">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/google-youtube-fact-checking-misinformation"">Google</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/formedia/mjp/programs/third-party-fact-checking/"">Meta</a>, <a href=""https://www.newsguardtech.com/press/microsoft-expands-newsguard-adoption/"">Microsoft</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>A plethora of legacy and social media companies also utilize the services provided by these organizations. A small sampling includes Associated Press, NPR, NBC News, Newsweek, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Nation, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, WhatsApp, Twitch, and LinkedIn. A look at <a href=""https://coveringclimatenow.org/partners/partner-list/"">Covering Climate Now’s list of partners</a> provides an even broader view of the media’s enforcement of the climate agenda.</p>

<p>As if governments, corporations, and organizations weren’t enough, universities such as <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/02/12/secret_partnership_fueling_climate_hawk_journalism___150480.html#!"">Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and University of Southern California</a> also perpetuate the climate propaganda by training journalists in their institutions.</p>

<p>By treating climate change as a <a href=""https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/10/11/why-climate-change-is-a-national-security-risk/"">national security threat</a>, the U.S. Department of Defense and <a href=""https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/intelligence-agencies-as-truth-telling-internet-informers"">intelligence agencies</a> have also been enlisted in the fight against mis- and disinformation.</p>

<p>In addition, individuals within <a href=""https://reason.com/2024/02/16/progressives-are-ditching-free-speech-to-fight-disinformation/"">both the left and right wings</a> of the two-party paradigm <a href=""https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0701/Why-free-speech-is-under-attack-from-right-and-left"">collude to curtail free speech</a>. It is a grave mistake to believe that calls for censorship from either side of the political spectrum are beneficial. They are both integral to perpetuating the media-censorship complex.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber?

The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies.

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming.

"BEIJING — China's real estate troubles are likely far from over and industry problems need to be addressed quickly if overall GDP growth is to pick up significantly, according to a report released Thursday by global investment firm KKR. That's one of the two key takeaways from a recent trip to China by the firm's head of global and macro asset allocation, Henry H. McVey. It was his fourth visit in just over a year. ""A fundamentally overbuilt real estate industry needs to be addressed — and quickly,"" he said in the report, which counts Changchun Hua, KKR's chief economist for Greater China, among the co-authors. ""Second, confidence must be restored to drive savings back down,"" McVey said, noting that would spur consumers and businesses to spend on upgrading to higher quality products, as Chinese authorities have promoted. Real estate and related sectors once accounted for about one fifth or more of China's economy, depending on the breadth of analysts' calculations. The property industry has slumped in the last few years after Beijing's crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Based on comparisons to housing corrections in the U.S., Japan and Spain, China's ""housing market correction may be just halfway complete"" in terms of its depth, the KKR report said. ""Both price and volume must come under pressure to finish the cleansing cycle,"" the report said. ""To date, though, it has largely been a contraction in volume."" While KKR's report didn't provide much detail on expectations for specific real estate policy, the authors said more action by Beijing to improve China's real estate sector ""could materially shift investor perception."" Amid geopolitical tensions, the country's property market slump and ""According to some of our proprietary survey work, many allocators have considered reducing China exposure to 5-6%, down from 10-12% today at a time that we think fundamentals in the economy are likely bottoming,"" the KKR report said. Much of official Chinese data to start the year beat analysts' expectations. Chinese officials have said the real estate sector remains in a period of adjustment, while Beijing shifts its emphasis Authorities have also released policies to promote financial support for select property developers, while many local governments — though not necessarily the largest cities — have significantly relaxed home purchase restrictions. KKR expects a modest slowdown in China's GDP growth to 4.7% this year, and 4.5% next year, with real estate and Covid-related factors halving their drag on the economy from 1.4 percentage points in 2024 to a 0.7 percentage point drag in 2025. ""Our bottom line is that: with the ongoing [property] correction as well as some potential further policy support, we think the drag to [the] overall economy should moderate a bit over the next few years,"" McVey said in a separate statement. He is also chief investment officer of KKR Balance Sheet. Catering, accommodation and wholesale are set to modestly increase their contribution to growth in the next two years, while digitalization and the shift toward more carbon-neutral, green industry are expected to remain the largest drivers of growth, according to the report. For investors, the report said a more important development than China's GDP increase would be whether authorities could make it easier for businesses and households to tap capital markets. ""Repairing soft spots in [the] economy, especially around housing, will ultimately improve the cost of capital, and will also allow new consumer companies to access the capital markets likely at better prices if real estate and confidence are doing better,"" McVey said in the statement. Beijing in March announced a GDP target of around 5% for this year. Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said last month that developers Recent data have pointed to some stabilization in the property sector slowdown. The seven-day-moving average of new home sales in 21 major cities fell by 34.5% year-on-year as of Monday, better than the 45.3% drop recorded a week earlier, according to Nomura, citing Wind Information. Compared with the same period in 2019, that sales average was only down by 27.8% as of Monday, versus a 47% drop a week earlier, Nomura said, noting most of the improvement was in China's biggest cities. KKR said most of its local portfolio is in consumer and services companies, whose business reflect how Chinese people in the middle to higher income range are spending modestly to upgrade their lifestyles. ""Top line growth is solid, margins are holding, and consumers are spending on less conspicuous items such as 'smart homes,' pets, and recreational activities,"" the report said. ""Domestic travel is also strong."" Retail sales rose by a better-than-expected 5.5% Longer term, KKR still expects that China can follow historical precedent in changing policy to be ""more investor friendly."" ""While our message is not an all-clear signal to lean in,"" the report said, ""it is a reminder – using history as our guide – that, if China does adjust its domestic policies to be more investor friendly (especially as it relates to supply side reforms), this market could rebound significantly from current levels.""

"At least half of adults in a range of major economies report being stressed about their personal finances, and say inflation is one of the main reasons. A significant number also say they feel worse-off financially than their parents, and are pessimistic about their children's financial futures, the In the U.S., Australia, Spain and Mexico, around 70% of adults said they were ""very or somewhat stressed"" about money. The percentage reduced slightly to 63% in the U.K., 57% in Germany, 55% in Switzerland, and roughly half of people in Singapore and France. Across those countries, between a half and two thirds of people said they considered themselves to be part of the middle class — except in the U.K., where it was a lower 37%. Yet despite the middle classes traditionally being considered financially comfortable, between 45% and 62% of those who put themselves in that group described themselves as ""living paycheck to paycheck."" Half of adults in Australia, Germany and the U.K. said they were worse off than they were five years ago. Meanwhile, of the countries surveyed, only adults in Singapore and Mexico were more likely than not to say they were better-off financially than their parents. Inflation was widely cited as the source of financial stress, along with a lack of savings, economic instability and rising interest rates. The study of 4,342 adults was carried out in March and released on Wednesday, ""The health of the global economy, though muted in some areas, is not being reflected in the perceptions of the average person ...

"Federal Reserve Chairman Speaking specifically about stronger-than-expected price pressures to start the year, the central bank leader said he and his fellow officials are in no rush to ease monetary policy. ""On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,"" Powell said in remarks ahead of a question-and-answer session at Stanford University. ""We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent,"" he added. ""Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy."" The remarks come two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold benchmark short-term borrowing rates steady. In addition, the committee's post-meeting statement on March 20 included the ""greater confidence"" qualifier needed before cutting. Markets widely expect the FOMC to start easing policy this year, though they have had to recalibrate their outlook for the timing and extent of cuts as inflation has held stubbornly higher. Other economic variables, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending, have held up as well, giving the Fed time to assess the current state of affairs before moving. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ""Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,"" Powell said. ""The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path."" Other Fed officials speaking this week have made remarks consistent with the Fed's patient approach. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic Powell reiterated that decisions are being made ""meeting by meeting"" and noted only that cuts are ""likely to be appropriate ... at some point this year."" The uncertainty about rates has caused some consternation in markets, with stocks falling sharply earlier this week as Treasury yields moved higher. The market stabilized Wednesday, but traders in the fed funds futures market again repriced their rate expectations, casting some doubt on a June cut as the market-implied probability moved to about 54% at one point, according to CME Group data. Along with his comments on rates, Powell spent some time discussing Fed independence. With the presidential election campaign heating up, Powell noted the importance of steering clear of political issues. ""Our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public,"" he said. ""We will not always get it right — no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term — and nothing else."" He also talked about ""mission creep,"" specifically as it relates to some demand for the Fed to get involved in climate change issues and the preparations financial institutions take for related events. ""We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,"" he said. Correction: Powell's remarks come two weeks after the Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold rates steady.

"BEIJING — Chinese electric car company Since November, Nio has partnered with at least four Chinese automakers — Changan, Geely, Chery and JAC — for developing battery swap standards and expanding the network in China. All these efforts are aimed at alleviating consumers' anxiety about driving range. While having a large network of battery charging stations helps address those concerns, battery swapping is a faster method as it takes only a few minutes. ""Swapping right now is mainly driven by Nio. Of course, Nio found out this is an ecosystem,"" CLSA's deputy head of research Ding Luo said in an interview. ""If only one player is trying to build up the whole ecosystem, it's impossible for [them]. That's why they're thinking whether they can invite some partners."" Battery swapping still isn't mainstream because the car batteries need to be standardized, he added. While a charging station resembles a typical gas station, battery-swap technology is housed in a shed-like structure. It uses machines to automatically exchange depleted batteries for pre-charged ones in compatible cars. Nio said in mid-March that it completed 40 million battery swaps compared with nearly 37 million charges at its public stations — Nio consumers can also access third-party charging stations, or install one at home. ""I think our outlook is very simple,"" Shen Fei, senior vice president of Nio's power division, said in Chinese translated by CNBC. ""The first thing is to serve Nio's users, and then provide a good battery charging and swapping experience, make charging more convenient than refueling, and at the same time help the company sell more cars."" The company claims that with battery swap, drivers can get a fresh charge in three minutes, if they opt in for a Shen said more car models will be added to Nio's battery swap network, while adding that swapping can allow drivers to keep abreast with improvements in battery technology. Power services and other products account for just about 10% of Nio's total revenue. The company said that category of ""other sales"" for 2023 grew by 69% to 6.36 billion yuan ($895.9 million). Nio does not break out swap station revenue. Battery swapping has been tried by the industry with mixed success, especially in the U.S. Tesla and a startup called Better Space tried out swapping more than 10 years ago, but the venture soon closed. In 2021, another startup, While it's not clear how much headway Ample has made in the U.S., the company has since expanded its partnerships overseas. Last month the company announced it would serve ""For swapping to work it can't be niche,"" Tu Le, head of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said. ""Battery inventory investment is massive, so it needs to be amortized over lots of swapping."" But he was cautious on whether Nio could sell enough of its own premium-priced cars to make the economics work. ""For now I still think the combination of swapping and charging makes for a pretty attractive feature set, but swapping alone likely doesn't help them sell that many more cars."" ""I think the nudge the Chinese government gave to encourage others to join forces with Nio on swapping could create the necessary pool of vehicles to make swapping viable,"" he added. Nio is the first major electric car company to roll out battery swap stations in addition to charging stations, alongside its own vehicles in mainland China and The company has installed more than 2,300 battery swap stations, and plans to install 1,000 more this year. Nio's investment in battery swap stations is about two years ahead of market demand, CEO William Li said last month, adding that less than a fifth of battery swap stations that Nio operates are processing 60 orders a day, likely the minimum orders needed for a station to break even. Nio's battery charging stations, on the other hand, reached profitability last year, according to the company. It plans to build 20,000 more this year. Passenger car battery swap stations can cost around $500,000 to build, while a relatively basic charging station with two ports costs around $200,000 to $300,000, according to Shay Natarajan, a North America-based partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund that invests in transportation. CLSA's Luo said businesses also prefer to invest in normal charging stations than swap stations because they make a higher return. But if businesses want to install faster-charging stations, he said they might face power grid challenges. CLSA's analysis found that the power required for five superchargers in one location would be more than what 300 families would normally consume. Tesla is also collaborating with automakers in battery charging, with its over 50,000 superchargers worldwide that claim to restore about two-thirds of a battery's charge in 15 minutes. In February, Ford reached a deal that allows its electric cars to The rapid development of electric cars, ostensibly aimed at reducing carbon emissions, also raises questions about battery waste. Nio pointed out that recent growth of new energy vehicles, which include hybrids, means nearly 20 million batteries will be reaching the end of their eight-year warranty period between 2025 and 2032. Last month, the company announced a partnership with battery giant Nio claimed that by using battery swap and big data, it can retain 80% of a battery's capacity after 12 years of use. Nio also said last month that CATL will develop batteries with longer lives for the company. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Michael Wayland contributed to this report.

"Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday that it's possible interest rates may have to move higher to control inflation, rather than the cuts her fellow officials have indicated are likely and that the market is expecting. Noting a number of potential upside risks to inflation, Bowman said policymakers need to be careful not to ease policy too quickly. ""While it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,"" she said in prepared remarks for a speech to a group of Fed watchers in New York. ""Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run."" As a member of the Board of Governors, Bowman is a permanent voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Since taking office in late 2018, her public speeches have put her on the more hawkish side of the FOMC, meaning she favors a more aggressive posture toward containing inflation. Bowman said her most likely outcome remains that ""it will eventually become appropriate to lower"" rates, though she noted that ""we are still not yet at the point"" of cutting as ""I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation."" The speech, to the Shadow Open Market Committee, comes with markets on edge about the near-term future of Fed policy. Statements this week from multiple officials, Futures traders are pricing in three cuts this year, though it has become a close call between June and July for when they start. FOMC members in March also penciled in three cuts this year, though one unidentified official in the ""dot plot"" indicated no decreases until 2026 and there was considerable dispersion otherwise about how aggressively the central bank would move. ""Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy,"" Bowman said. Weighing inflation risks, she said that supply-side improvements that helped bring numbers down this year may not have the same impact going forward. Moreover, she cited geopolitical risks and fiscal stimulus as other upside hazards, along with stubbornly higher housing prices and labor market tightness. ""Inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services,"" Bowman said.

"Decades of trade deficits and a strong dollar created too many ""losers"" in the U.S. economy who turned to Donald Trump's protectionist policies, according to Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute — and those conditions remain. Trump's ""America First"" economic policies led his administration to institute a slew of trade tariffs on China, Mexico, the European Union and others, including slapping 25% duties on imported steel and aluminum. As the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, Trump has proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a minimum levy of 60% on imported Chinese products. These policies have drawn widespread criticism from economists, who argue that tariffs are counterproductive, as they make imported goods more expensive for the average American. Speaking to CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Forum on Friday, Koo said protectionism was a ""horrible thing,"" but that Trump's approach ""does have some economic logic."" ""When we studied economics and free trade, in particular, we were taught...that free trade always creates both winners and losers in the same economy, but the gain that winners get is always greater than the loss of the losers, so the society as a whole always gains. So that's why the free trade is good,"" he noted. Koo nevertheless argued that this rests on the assumption that trade flows are balanced or in surplus, while the U.S. has been running huge deficits for the last forty years, which have expanded the number of ""losers."" ""By 2016, the number of people who consider themselves losers of free trade, were large enough to elect Trump president, and so we have to really go back and say to ourselves: what did we do wrong to allow this many people in United States to view themselves as losers of free trade?"" he said. For Koo, the key problem was the exchange rate, as the strength of the U.S. dollar incentivized foreign imports and hurt U.S. companies exporting around the world. ""We kind of let the exchange rate be decided by so-called market forces, speculators, my clients, Wall Street types, but the foreign exchange rate has to be set in a way that the number of losers does not grow to a point where the free trade itself is lost,"" Koo said. He pointed to a similar pivotal moment in 1985, when President Ronald Reagan faced the same issue of a strong dollar and rising protectionism. At the time, Reagan responded by facilitating the Plaza Accord with France, West Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom to depreciate the U.S. dollar against the respective currencies of these countries through intervention in the foreign exchange market. ""That's the kind of thing we should have been more conscious of doing. Instead of allowing [the] dollar to go wherever the market takes [it], and then these people who are not as fortunate as we are in the financial markets, end up suffering and end up voting for Mr. Trump,"" Koo added. He argued that economists need to move beyond the idea that the trade deficit is simply down to ""too much investment"" and ""too few savings"" in the U.S., as this means deficit can only be reduced by remaining in recession until domestic demand weakens so much that U.S. companies can export more goods, which would not be possible in a democracy. Koo again pointed to past dealings with Japan, suggesting that if the argument held that overseas companies are just filling in where U.S. companies cannot satisfy domestic demand, then the American companies fighting Japanese firms in the 1970s and 70s should have recorded huge profits due to excess demand. ""But that did not actually happen. It's the opposite that happened. So many of them went bankrupt, so many losers of free trade were left in the streets, because it was not savings and investment issue, it was the exchange rate issue,"" he said. ""The dollar should have been much weaker, and Reagan understood that that's why he took that action.""

With all sorts of financial considerations vying for attention — Here are some of the biggest financial blind spots, according to several certified financial planners on CNBC's Digital Financial Consumers often don't understand the importance of their The score impacts how easily consumers can get a loan — like a mortgage, credit card or auto loan — and the interest rate they pay on that debt. The number generally ranges from 300 to 850. Credit agencies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion determine the score using a formula that accounts for Lenders are generally more willing to give loans and better interest rates to borrowers with credit scores in the mid- to high-700s or above, Let's say a consumer wants a $300,000 fixed mortgage for a 30-year term. The average person with a credit score between 760 and 850 would get a 6.5% interest rate, according to national FICO data as of April 1. By comparison, someone with a score of 620 to 639 would get an 8.1% rate. The latter's monthly payment would cost $324 more relative to the person with a better credit score — amounting to an extra $116,000 over the life of the loan, according to FICO's Wills are basic They spell out who gets your money after you die. Wills can also stipulate who will take care of your kids and oversee your money until your children turn 18. Planning for such a grim event isn't fun — but it's essential, said Barry Glassman, CFP, founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services. ""I'm shocked by the number of well-to-do families with kids who have no will in place,"" Glassman said. Without such a legal document, state courts Taking it a step further, individuals can create trusts, which can assign more control over details like the age at which children gain access to inherited funds, Glassman said. Choosing how much money to stash away for a One household might need three months of savings while another might need a year, she said. Emergency funds include money to cover the necessities — like mortgage, rent, utility and grocery payments — in the event of an unexpected event like job loss. A single person should generally try to save at least six months' worth of emergency expenses, Elliott said. That's also true for married couples where both spouses work at the same company or in the same industry; the risk of a job loss occurring at or around the same time is relatively high, Elliott said. Meanwhile, a couple in which the spouses make a similar income but work in different fields and occupations may only need three months of expenses. If something unexpected happens to one spouse's employment, the odds are good that the couple can temporarily lean on the other spouse's income, she said. Business owners should aim to have at least a year of expenses saved since their income can fluctuate, as the Covid-19 pandemic showed, Elliott added. Tax withholding is a pay-as-you-go system. Employers estimate your annual tax bill and withhold tax from each paycheck accordingly. ""Ten out of 10 people couldn't explain how the tax withholding system works,"" said Ted Jenkin, CFP, CEO and founder of oXYGen Financial based in Atlanta. Employers partly base those withholdings on information workers supply on a W-4 form. Generally, taxpayers who get a refund during tax season withheld too much from their paychecks throughout the year. They receive those overpayments from the government via a refund. However, those who owe money to Uncle Sam didn't withhold enough to satisfy their annual tax bill and must make up the difference. People who owe money often blame their accountants or tax software instead of themselves, even though they can generally control how much is withheld, Jenkin said. Someone who owes more than $500 to $1,000 may want to change their withholding, Jenkin said. That goes for someone who gets a big refund as well; instead, they may wish to save (and earn interest on) that extra cash throughout the year, Jenkin said. Workers can fill out a new W-4 form to change their withholding. They may wish to do so upon any major life event like a marriage, divorce or birth of a child to avoid surprises come tax time. ""I think people underestimate how much money they're going to need in retirement,"" Elliott said. Many people assume their spending will decline when they retire, perhaps to roughly 60% to 70% of spending during their working years, she said. But that's not always the case. ""Yes, maybe the kids are out of the house but now that you're retired you have more time, meaning you have more time to do things,"" Elliott said. She asks clients to envision how they want to spend their lives in retirement — travel and hobbies, for example — to estimate how their spending might change. That helps guide overall savings goals. Households also don't often account for the potential need for long-term care, which can be costly, in their calculations, she said.

"A global gold rush is underway for a long-overlooked resource that advocates say could play a significant role in the Geologic hydrogen, sometimes referred to as white, gold or natural hydrogen, refers to hydrogen gas that is found in its natural form beneath Earth's surface. It is Hydrogen has Green hydrogen, a process that involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity, is one exception from what's known as the hydrogen It's within this context that momentum has been building around geologic hydrogen. Exploratory efforts are now underway in countries such as the U.S., Canada, Australia, France, Spain, Colombia, South Korea and others. Research The consulting firm, which described the pursuit of geologic hydrogen as a ""white gold rush,"" said the hype stems from hopes that the untapped resource could be a ""gamechanger"" in the clean energy transition. ""I would say this is something relatively old and new in a way,"" Minh Khoi Le, head of hydrogen research at Rystad Energy, told CNBC via videoconference. ""The first project that found hydrogen was a while ago, but it never picked up from there, right? People never seriously tried to go for exploration."" The Almost two decades later, subsequent exploration at the site Last year, researchers Geoffrey Ellis, a research geologist at the Energy Resources Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), told CNBC that there could be a vast amount of naturally occurring hydrogen buried in underground reservoirs around the world. Based on current understanding, Ellis said there is likely to be about 5 trillion metric tons of geologic hydrogen in Earth's interior, although most of this is likely to be too deep or too far offshore to be economically recovered. Nonetheless, Ellis said that just a few percent of geologic hydrogen recovery might well be enough to supply all projected demand for 200 years. ""The potential is there but we've got to do the work,"" Ellis said via videoconference, adding that more investment is necessary to accelerate early-stage research and development. The U.S. Department of Energy last month ""Natural hydrogen has created a lot of excitement at the moment but in terms of potential I think it is still a little bit uncertain because none of these projects have actually started producing or extracting hydrogen — except for that one in Mali,"" Rystad Energy's Le told CNBC. Le said there were still ""a lot of question marks around the whole story about natural hydrogen,"" but there appeared to be ""some substance"" behind the hype. ""If some of these numbers that certain institutes, like the USGS, about the potential volume that you can extract … come true, it can actually play quite a significant role,"" he added. Not everyone's convinced. Some have expressed skepticism about the clean energy potential of natural hydrogen. ""Sometimes we want to run before we can walk,"" Ana Maria Jaller-Makarewicz, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told CNBC via videoconference. The first near-term priority for hydrogen, Jaller-Makarewicz said, should be looking for ways to replace so-called grey hydrogen with green hydrogen. Grey hydrogen — ""Don't confuse the idea of 'we need to find the solution' with the reality,"" Jaller-Makarewicz said. Separately, the Hydrogen Science Coalition, a group of academics, scientists and engineers seeking to bring an evidence-based view to hydrogen's role in the energy transition, What's more, the coalition says there are environmental concerns about the extraction process, and transportation and distribution challenges mean geologic hydrogen is not likely to be found where it is needed most. ""Considering findings to date, what we know about geologic hydrogen systems, and the fact that favourable settings appear rare, the odds of finding geologic hydrogen that can be extracted at the scale of large natural gas developments looks relatively slim,"" the coalition said on March 14.

Myrivili said she believes that extreme heat is often overlooked ""Heat, I believe it to the bottom of my heart, is going to be the number one public health challenge that we will be dealing with in the next decade. And we need to prepare for it now,"" Myrivili told CNBC via videoconference. ""We can — but we really need to make it a priority.""

The CDC warns that even young and healthy people can be affected. The first person in the world to be assigned as a CHO was Jane Gilbert, who was appointed in 2021 to oversee Florida's most populous county, Miami-Dade. The CHO role was created by the Atlantic Council's Arsht-Rock Resilience Center, a U.S.-based think tank that aims to support 1 billion people with resilience solutions by 2030.

We are used to the heat so that makes it really hard to distinguish between normal heat and unsafe heat,"" Bushra Afreen, CHO for Dhaka North in Bangladesh, told CNBC via videoconference. Afreen, who became Dhaka North's CHO in May last year, said stark income inequality in the country's largest city meant excessive heat was not a universally similar experience.

Alongside planting thousands of trees in Dhaka North's informal settlements and reintroducing a culture of water fountains in the city, Afreen said her team would roll out a pilot project in one city settlement to create green nooks and corners for reprieve. Afreen said it would be important to consider the type of trees to plant, such as citrus or neem trees to ward off mosquitoes ""Right now, the two reactions that we're seeing most are 'good job, keep it up, we need more awareness,'"" Afreen said. ""And the other kind is, 'oh, you're going to decrease the heat? Good luck.'"" Tiffany Crawford, co-CHO of Melbourne, told CNBC that extreme heat kills more people in Australia than bushfires, floods and storms. ""There's a reason for that, and it's the lag in the data,"" she said. Crawford, who works alongside Krista Milne as CHOs of Melbourne, said the true scale of heat-related deaths and illnesses often doesn't became clear until health authorities have pored through hospital admissions and ambulance data. With a population of roughly 5 million, the southeastern Australian city of Melbourne is known for its mild and temperate climate — but Crawford says it is prone to spates of summer heatwaves that last for several days and offer scant reprieve through the night.

I liken it to going outside and it's like someone left the oven door open or the heater on all night and forgot to turn it off,"" Crawford said.

"The idea of using pre-assembled components in housebuilding is Modern tech-enabled versions of modular housing promise a faster, more sustainable solution to housing crises, according to experts. But the sector has seen better adoption in some countries compared to others where it has failed to scale — such as the U.K. Prefabrication has existed in many forms, from the Fast forward a century and entire modules can be built in factories to then be combined to create houses in The fact that modular housing is also made in a controlled factory environment means less waste is generated, while also resulting in more Building entire sections in one place also means fewer delivery trips to sites, Shepherd explained. A 2022 Another study by academics at the University of Cambridge and Edinburgh Napier University, published in 2022, found that modular home construction can result in Despite these benefits, the sector has seen a number of setbacks in recent years and it remains relatively nascent in the U.K. and U.S. In January, it was reported that U.K. firm Modulous had Jonatan Pinkse, professor of sustainable business at King's College London, highlighted that part of the challenge for modular construction firms is that they first have to spend money on building a factory in which to construct modules and then need to have the projects in the pipeline to pay for this investment. He suggested that this presented more difficulty when coupled with the headwinds that also affected the wider construction sector, including higher energy costs and interest rates, as well as a cost-of-living crisis in many nations prompting people to hold off on house buying. ""And if you then can't profit from a market that is actually going up, but instead is going down, then the problem is simply that [firms] can't earn back their money fast enough, and investors then lose their trust in the business model,"" Pinkse told CNBC. Pinkse was one of the co-authors on Suzanne Peters, who also co-authored the research and is a research associate at Alliance Manchester Business School, told CNBC that the construction sector more broadly is a ""very tough business"" with a higher amount of failures versus other industries. Provisional Similarly, Daniel Paterson, director of government affairs at Make UK Modular, said that the modular housing sector had faced a ""series of unfortunate events,"" as the industry had essentially only launched in the U.K. in its current format in 2016/17. He explained that firms then need around 18 months to build factories, meaning it wasn't long before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, along with the economic headwinds that followed. Perceptions based on previous versions of prefabrication was another issue, according to Richard Valentine-Selsey, head of European living research and consultancy at Savills Research. He told CNBC that, in the U.K., there is the ""1960s hangover from prefabrication and the kind of connotations that has with lower quality, things that don't last and all the kind of negative impacts of that from the building boom post-war."" In addition, he said that the ""construction industry is quite a conservative beast and finds it very challenging at times to change and think forward and innovate unless their forced to do it, which has kind of led to flirtation with new methods but no kind of wholesale change towards delivering using modular."" Sweden and Japan are the countries cited as By comparison, a Make UK Modular In Sweden, one of the major players in this space is BoKlok, which is jointly owned by construction firm Skanska and homes and furniture company Ikea, and has been around since the mid-1990s. Shepherd pointed out that Sweden is also ""not a country where you can build 12 months of the year."" ""They have very deep winters with limited daylight, so there is an incentive to look at an alternative construction process to keep people working all year, to get houses delivered at the volume needed,"" he explained. Valentine-Selsey said that in Japan there was also a difference in the approach to residential buildings. ""In Japan, the value of the building depreciates over about 30 years, so by the end of that you kind of knock it down and rebuild it because it is worthless,"" he explained, making new building methods useful, given that the delivery of new homes is higher. Looking at these examples, could methods such as modular help tackle the U.K.'s affordable housing shortage? The current U.K. government has the target of building 300,000 homes a year, but ""That's 300,000 houses a year, and there is zero chance … of that happening if there is not some form different approach adopted,"" Shepherd said. Looking ahead, Valentine-Selsey said he was an ""optimist"" in his outlook for the modular sector. ""I think we're probably going to see an uptake again over the next five to 10 years,"" he said. However, he believed that greater adoption of other types of MMC, such as panelized solutions, was more likely, but thought ""modular will form part of that new mix of delivery.""

""People have really adopted the flexible working style, and it resonates with travelers,"" Virgin Voyages' CEO Nirmal Saverimuttu told The Booking the ""Season Pass"" is 30% cheaper than booking four week-long cruises back to back, according to Virgin's website. Travelers can also swap out travel companions for different legs of the cruise, said Saverimuttu, as long as they are 18 or older, in line with Virgin Voyages' Within 24 hours of announcing the Season Pass, more than 2,000 people registered interest in it, said Saverimuttu. When bookings opened, spots on the month-long cruise — which stops at places like Cannes, Rome and Ibiza — sold out in 48 hours, a company representative told CNBC Travel. That prompted Virgin Voyages to open additional spots for remote workers on a second cruise ship this summer. The ""Season Pass"" cruises will sail on Virgin's Scarlet Lady and Resilient Lady ships, each of which can accommodate around 2,700 guests. Cruises are scheduled to sail from June to September this year. The popularity of Virgin's Season Pass cruise stems from the broader shift to remote work since the Covid-19 pandemic.

"A series of climate records last year gave new meaning to the phrase ""off the charts,"" the United Nation's weather agency said Tuesday, warning that the planet is now on the brink of surpassing a key warming threshold. In its annual ""State of the Global Climate"" report, researchers at the World Meteorological Organization outlined how extreme weather events in 2023 wreaked havoc for millions of people across the globe and inflicted billions of dollars in economic losses. The WMO said records were broken, and in some cases, smashed, for indicators such as greenhouse gas levels, ocean heat and acidification, sea level rise, Antarctic Sea ice cover and glacier retreat. It confirmed The global average temperature in 2023 stood at 1.45 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, researchers said, marginally below the key warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The 1.5 degrees Celsius level is widely recognized as an indicator of when climate impacts become increasingly harmful to people and the planet, as outlined in the Extreme temperatures are ""Never have we been so close — albeit on a temporary basis at the moment — to the 1.5°C lower limit of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a statement. ""The WMO community is sounding the Red Alert to the world,"" she said. ""Climate change is about much more than temperatures. What we witnessed in 2023, especially with the unprecedented ocean warmth, glacier retreat and Antarctic sea ice loss, is cause for particular concern."" The report comes shortly after the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service The EU climate monitor's findings, published last month, did not represent a break of the 2015 Paris Agreement, however. The climate accord aims to ""limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" over the long term. Nonetheless, scientists have ""Earth's issuing a distress call,"" United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Tuesday. ""The latest State of the Global Climate report shows a planet on the brink. Fossil fuel pollution is sending climate chaos off the charts,"" he added. ""Sirens are blaring across all major indicators. … Some records aren't just chart-topping, they're chart-busting. And changes are speeding up.""

Renewable energy generation was described as one ""glimmer of hope,"" however. The WMO said renewable energy generation had surged to the forefront of climate action in 2023, citing its potential to help achieve decarbonization targets.

"In this article A car loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot, but electric vehicles are taking this adage to a new level. That's becoming a major barrier to wider adoption, according to some industry and investment experts. A recent While lower used EV prices could increase their desirability to some buyers, they can also reduce demand for new electric vehicles, according to Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. ""The value a new car loses in the first few years is the single most expensive aspect of owning a new vehicle,"" he said, explaining that ""as more new car shoppers become aware of the massive drop in EV values they will be less interested in buying one."" Speaking to CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Monday, David Kuo, stock analyst and co-founder at the Smart Investor, said that the inability of EVs to retain value had kept him from investing in the industry. According to Kuo, EVs are analogous to other consumer electronics like laptops and cell phones in that they tend to lose value and relevance quickly after being sold. ""The same [depreciation] is going to happen to electric vehicles; it'll probably cost you $20,000, $30,000 to buy one, but in a year's time it will depreciate much faster than an internal combustion engine car,"" he said. Industry insiders have also flagged EV resale problems. Kuo further argued that the software and computing capabilities of used EVs may become outdated and incompatible with updates by the time they are sold or even beforehand. That will be a ""lightbulb moment"" when buyers realize they paid too much in the first place, he added. Despite EVs' apparent depreciation issue, its causes might have less to do with the technology itself and more to do with market conditions. According to iSeeCars, dramatic drops in used electric vehicle values in the U.S. have largely been driven by aggressive price cuts by Tesla is the dominant EV seller in the U.S. and as a result of lower prices for its new EVs, buyers are less likely to entertain the same price levels for used alternatives. ""If [Elon Musk] continues to reduce Tesla prices in an effort to stimulate sales, he'll continue to pull the entire market down, as he did over the past 15 months,"" iSeeCars' Brauer said. In an October earnings call, Musk defended the price cuts, emphasizing the importance of cost to consumers. ""It's not an optional thing for most people; it is a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable so people can buy them,"" he said. In the following quarter's earnings call in January, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said the company would continue to focus on its cost reduction efforts in 2024. Since then, the EV price war between Tesla and Chinese competitors has Additionally, overproduction of EVs relative to demand has created excessive supply, making it unlikely for new and used EV prices to rebound in the near term, according to Brauer. What is an ongoing issue for the EV market, however, may be a boon for electric and combustion powered hybrids, which are showing increasing strength in new and used vehicle markets. The average price for used hybrid vehicles fell only 6.5% or $2,135 last year — a fraction of the decline of the average EV. ""Hybrids are an excellent stepping stone between gasoline and electric cars, and I expect to see them increasing in popularity over the next 10 years,"" Brauer said.

"The widespread arrival of generative artificial intelligence has prompted alarm from many quarters. A But doom is only one interpretation of AI. According to experts paid to predict the future, the arrival of AI is more likely than not to offer a roadmap out of humanity's worst impulses and create a better, more equitable world. That's the rosy scenario outlined in ""We are now at a point in time where science and technology can enable the advancement of humanity in a way we have not seen in a long time,"" said Frank Diana, managing partner and principal futurist at Tata. ""We are in a place we haven't been since the second industrial revolution,"" he said, predicting that AI's widespread arrival will herald innovation in This view is a world away from some prominent tech leaders who have Diana says the doomsday scenarios distract and undermine the technology's potential. ""I think, honestly, the conversation around conscious robots and artificial superintelligence gets in the way,"" Diana said. ""If AI is managed correctly, we will instead talk about all the great things AI can do for humanity."" He said today's often negative view of AI in the popular imagination has roots in the 1970s when Hollywood shifted towards more ominous themes that matched the country's mood. But before that, he said, technology was viewed as something that could one day deliver utopia. Author and futurist Bernard Marr, who was not involved in the Tata survey, echoed the more optimistic thinking. ""I see all the amazing benefits AI can bring and I see it every day. I believe AI is the most powerful technology humans have ever had access to,"" Marr said, a power he believes can be used to bulldoze inequities and challenges in health, education, and climate change. ""We are a very long way from AI becoming sentient, if ever. But AI is very, very good at doing things that in the past only humans could do,"" Marr said. ""The mundane is a waste of our power as humans. AI will allow us to focus on the amazing power that makes us human,"" he added. He sees AI's role evolving into being a constant co-pilot rather than staying awake at night worrying about robots taking over the planet. ""AI will make doctor and patient relationships much better,"" Marr said, describing how the insurance and regulatory paperwork that bogs doctors down now will be taken over by AI, freeing up the practitioner to spend more time with patients. ""I don't see AI as anything scary; all the systems being developed are not working against humans but are making us better."" Given AI's power, regulations, laws, and safeguards are necessary to prevent abuse. ""But already you are starting to see that happen,"" Marr said, referring So why the widespread fear? When people talk about sentient AI, they usually turn immediately to the ominous. Sentient, however, can also be benevolent or values-neutral, but that is not the AI people usually think about. The reason people fear AI lies in our very humanity, said Kelsey Latimer, a Florida-based clinical psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorder. She said that humans are hard-wired to brace themselves for the worst. ""From an evolutionary point of view, we are primed to see the negative and scary things so that we could see the predators coming toward us and respond,"" Latimer said. If we view something as unfavorable and it turns out to be positive, no harm is done. If we view something as positive but it turns out to be negative, then we often need to prepare for the consequences. Futurists like Diana and Marr predict the consequences of AI will be positive ones.

"Israel said on Saturday its special forces had recovered the body of a hostage killed while being held captive in Gaza, as the Palestinian enclave's dominant Islamist movement Hamas said it would take part in a new round of Almost six months into the war, Israel has faced protests at home demanding a deal to free the dwindling number of live hostages from Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border rampage. Western countries, meanwhile, have voiced outrage over what they see as an unacceptably high Palestinian civilian toll and the accompanying humanitarian crisis. The body of Elad Katzir, a 47-year-old Israeli farmer, was unearthed by commandos in southern Khan Younis overnight, the military said. He had been killed by his Palestinian Islamic Jihad captors and buried there in mid-January, it said, citing intelligence information about which it declined to elaborate. Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, had no immediate comment. Katzir was among 253 people dragged into Gaza by Hamas-led gunmen who killed some 1,200 others in southern Israel, according to official tallies, sparking an offensive that medics in the enclave say has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians. His father Avraham was killed in their kibbutz, Nir Oz, and his mother Hanna was also taken hostage but freed in November under a truce. Qatari and Egyptian mediators have been trying to secure another deal that might return some of the 129 remaining hostages in a longer ceasefire in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry on Saturday reported one of the lowest daily death tolls in six months, saying 46 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. The Gaza-based ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants in its reports but local health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians. Israel says at least a third are fighters. Hamas on Saturday said its fighters targeted three Israeli tanks in Khan Younis with missiles, inflicting casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, though it said earlier that troops had engaged with gunmen in the area. The World Health Organisation said its team had managed to reach Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where Israeli special forces conducted a two-week raid against suspected militants, leaving a wasteland of destroyed buildings. The team saw at least five dead bodies at the complex, most of which had suffered extensive destruction. ""Even restoring minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible,"" said a statement from WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Al-Shifa, the Gaza Strip's biggest hospital before the war, was one of the few healthcare facilities that had been partially operational in the north of enclave before the raid. Angered by an Israeli air strike that killed aid workers in Gaza, U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday urged an ""immediate ceasefire"" and for Israel to boost humanitarian relief measures. Israel approved the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of its Ashdod port following the U.S. criticism, measures welcomed on Saturday by U.N. aid coordinator Jamie McGoldrick. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid told N12's Meet the Press on Saturday that he was travelling to Washington where he will meet U.S. officials next week. The Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether senior officials will meet Lapid. Hamas said it would send a delegation to Cairo on Sunday for a new round of mediated talks. Israel was undecided on whether to attend, an Israeli official said, citing concern that the event would be ""more political theatre than actual progress"". Hamas wants any deal to bring about an end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israel has said that, after any truce, it would topple Hamas, which is sworn to its destruction. A rally in Jerusalem calling on leaders to secure a hostage release was set to take place on Sunday, which marks six months since the Oct. 7 attack, and anti-government protesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday called for an election. In a Jan. 8 video posted by Islamic Jihad online, Katzir said: ""I was close to dying more than once. It's a miracle I'm still alive ... I want to tell my family that I love them very much and I miss them very much."" Based on various sources of information, Israel has declared at least 35 hostages as dead in Gaza captivity. Palestinian factions have said some were killed in Israeli strikes. While confirming this in several cases, Israel says that, in others, hostages whose bodies were recovered bore signs of execution.

"Donald Trump's campaign said it raised $50.5 million on Saturday, a staggering reported haul as his campaign works to catch up to the fundraising juggernaut of President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. The reported haul from the event with major donors at the Palm Beach, Florida, home of billionaire investor John Paulson sets a ""It's clearer than ever that we have the message, the operation, and the money to propel President Trump to victory on November 5,"" his campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement. The event, billed as the ""Inaugural Leadership Dinner,"" sends a signal of a resurgence of Trump and the Republican Party's fundraising, ""This has been some incredible evening before it even starts because people — they wanted to contribute to a cause of making America great again, and that's what's happened,"" Trump said briefly to reporters as he arrived at the event with his wife Melania Trump. Trump and the GOP announced earlier in the week that they raised more than $65.6 million in March and closed out the month with $93.1 million. ""While Donald Trump has been busy awarding himself golf trophies at Mar-a-Lago and palling around with billionaires, Joe Biden has been crisscrossing the nation connecting with voters and outlining his vision to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out,"" Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement, referring to Trump's Florida residence. Campaign fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission detailing donations from Saturday's event are not expected until a mid-July filing date. Trump initially Saturday's high-dollar event hosted about 100 guests, including more than a few billionaires. Contributions to the event will go toward the Trump 47 Committee, according to the invitation, a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, state Republican parties and Save America, a political action committee that pays the bulk of Trump's legal bills. In an unusual arrangement, the fundraising agreement directs donations to first pay the maximum allowed under law to his campaign and Save America before the RNC or state parties get a cut. Donors who gave the suggested $814,600 per person or $250,000 per person will only have $5,000 of their donation go to Save America, sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cash-strapped RNC. As Trump prepared in March to install a new handpicked leadership team at the RNC, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, some members of the RNC worried that the committee's money would go toward Trump's sizable legal fees as he fights a number of court cases, including four criminal cases. The fundraising arrangement doesn't direct RNC funds to Trump's legal bills.

"Heli-skiing on virgin snow in Antarctica Big-ticket travel experiences like those are indicative of the "" Now, stealth wealth is spilling into the travel industry, as one-percenters are increasingly forgoing glitzy see-and-be-seen destinations, such as Capri, for more discreet getaways. Jaclyn Sienna India, the founder of the ultra-luxury travel company While others may prefer the boulevards of Paris or the shores of Monaco, she escapes to Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City once a year. She said her clients are focused more than ever on their families, well-being and mental health ""because the world is a lot more stressful."" As a result, they seek more connection than limelight when they travel. But another important aspect of the quiet luxury movement concerns security. Since celebrity homes have been a target for thieves of late, high-profile events like the Super Bowl are less attractive, India said. Consequently, clients are seeking remote destinations, often at a moment's notice, she said. ""We just booked a billionaire family on an island in a villa in Brazil. Brazil is not a place that immediately comes to mind … But, to me, it's a place that still holds authenticity and soul. It's got great food and an incredible spa and wellness culture,"" India said. Africa is another place where clients can seek solitude, she said. It was the choice of former U.S. President George W. Bush, whom she accompanied on a painstakingly organized personal trip to Ethiopia in 2015, she said. Roman & Erica Jackowitz manages the lifestyle needs of 30 families, from politicians and tech CEOs to hedge fund executives, she said. For them, quiet luxury travel is about exclusivity and privacy, she said. But the pandemic accelerated a desire among wealthy travelers to have meaningful experiences — which can range from requests for recommendations on where to take a quiet morning hike to organizing a game of tennis with Roger Federer, she said. The business of catering to the ultra-rich comes with a fresh challenge: availability. According to a 2023 Henley & Partners report, there are 28,420 centi-millionaires worldwide, which are those with investable assets of at least $100 million. Jackowitz said her clients never opt for conventional cruises, as they prefer chartering private yachts. In fact, she said the ""You're now competing with 10 other people traveling with friends and family,"" she said. ""There are just so many more people who can afford these kinds of experiences."" That's leading moneyed travelers to search for new places for solitude, she said. The next frontier? Space, she said.

"Reservations for Italy's new ""La Dolce Vita Orient Express"" train open Tuesday. Luxury train enthusiasts may want to lock in the current rate now — before it climbs any higher. Starting rates for a one-night journey on the luxury train increased from But starting rates have now jumped to That's an eye-watering 75% price increase in a 16-month period. The train is set to start running in the spring of 2025, according to Accor, the French multinational hospitality company that operates the train. Accor did not directly answer CNBC's question as to the reason behind the steep price hike. A representative said, ""Pricing evolves according to occupancy, season, route, and cabin type."" However, again, the train isn't operating yet. Ticket prices are still lower than another train using the ""Orient Express"" moniker in Europe — the Dave Goodger, managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics company, said rising prices are caused by consumers' continued willingness to pay higher rates for luxury experiences. But, he said, that's likely not the only reason. ""Luxury travel demand is reflected in some continued price increases,"" he said. ""However, the price increases are not profiteering and are broadly in line with rising costs, including higher staff costs as well as increased debt service requirements."" Goodger called the La Dolce Vita train's price increase ""something of an outlier,"" but also noted it's reflective of the unique service it provides. Accor's La Dolce Vita Orient Express is set to run The ""La Dolce Vita"" train — which translates to ""the sweet life"" — channels the era of Italian glamour captured by Federico Fellini's famed 1960 movie of the same name. The film is perhaps best remembered for the scene in which actor Reservations for the train open via telephone on April 2, and via the train's Accor has plans to launch another train — named ""The Orient Express"" — using restored 19th-century carriages that were once part of the historic ""Nostalgie-Istanbul-Orient-Express.""

"In this article The travel industry is largely back on track. But high prices in the luxury sector, which rose in the wake of the Covid pandemic, aren't returning to normal. In fact, they're growing higher by the month. Luxury hotel rates reached ""peak levels"" this year, with average daily rates up 70% compared to 2019, according to the luxury travel company Virtuoso. ""July 2024 stands out with the highest rate, marking an 85% increase compared to July 2019,"" a company representative told CNBC Travel. The price for luxury train travel is also soaring, with rates for Accor's yet-to-be-opened La Dolce Vita Orient-Express Rates on another luxury European train, Belmond's Belmond has not yet responded to CNBC's request for comment, but Accor told CNBC Travel that pricing and plans ""are constantly evolving."" Travel prices have increased for many of the same reasons that have affected other industries: inflation, rising labor costs, supply chain issues and debt service rates. But travelers' unflinching willingness to pay the new rates means the ""old"" prices for a five-star holiday may be a thing of the past. As inflation and rising costs abate, luxury travel prices are holding firm. That's because at significantly higher rates, ""the demand is there,"" said Henry Harteveldt, president of the travel market research company, Atmosphere Research Group ""Money is almost no object for some of these guests,"" Harteveldt told "" Wealthy travelers also value new and different experiences, such as luxury train travel, he said. ""They want something exclusive ... and these companies are going to capitalize on it while they can."" For price-conscious travelers, competition will temper costs at the budget and mid-scale sectors, said Harteveldt. ""For those of us who live on planet Earth… budget airfares have been coming down because competition there is growing,"" he said. ""Budget and midscale hotels are among the fastest growing in the hotel sector. They too introduce lower pricing as they open or expand the number of properties in those categories."" Booking early can save money on airfares, but hotel pricing works differently, he said. ""With hotels, you either book early or wait until within two weeks of your travel date,"" said Harteveldt. ""I personally book refundable and changeable hotel rates [because] I have noticed that, in some cases, hotel rates can go down... closer to the check-in date, if demand isn't where they expected it to be."" Overall, travel demand remains strong, yet surveys show some travelers are beginning to buckle under the costs. But this isn't affecting the luxury travel sphere at the same level, said Dave Goodger, managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics company. ""The luxury boom continues despite the flatlining economic activity in some major developed markets,"" he told CNBC Travel. The industry continues to see upward pricing pressure for luxury experiences, he said. ""This has come as some travellers have traded up for more luxury experiences,"" he said. ""It also reflects the fact that income and wealth levels, including accumulated savings, remain healthy for higher net wealth households.""

"A series of climate records last year gave new meaning to the phrase ""off the charts,"" the United Nation's weather agency said Tuesday, warning that the planet is now on the brink of surpassing a key warming threshold. In its annual ""State of the Global Climate"" report, researchers at the World Meteorological Organization outlined how extreme weather events in 2023 wreaked havoc for millions of people across the globe and inflicted billions of dollars in economic losses. The WMO said records were broken, and in some cases, smashed, for indicators such as greenhouse gas levels, ocean heat and acidification, sea level rise, Antarctic Sea ice cover and glacier retreat. It confirmed The global average temperature in 2023 stood at 1.45 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, researchers said, marginally below the key warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The 1.5 degrees Celsius level is widely recognized as an indicator of when climate impacts become increasingly harmful to people and the planet, as outlined in the Extreme temperatures are ""Never have we been so close — albeit on a temporary basis at the moment — to the 1.5°C lower limit of the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a statement. ""The WMO community is sounding the Red Alert to the world,"" she said. ""Climate change is about much more than temperatures. What we witnessed in 2023, especially with the unprecedented ocean warmth, glacier retreat and Antarctic sea ice loss, is cause for particular concern."" The report comes shortly after the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service The EU climate monitor's findings, published last month, did not represent a break of the 2015 Paris Agreement, however. The climate accord aims to ""limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" over the long term. Nonetheless, scientists have ""Earth's issuing a distress call,"" United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said Tuesday. ""The latest State of the Global Climate report shows a planet on the brink. Fossil fuel pollution is sending climate chaos off the charts,"" he added. ""Sirens are blaring across all major indicators. … Some records aren't just chart-topping, they're chart-busting. And changes are speeding up.""

Renewable energy generation was described as one ""glimmer of hope,"" however. The WMO said renewable energy generation had surged to the forefront of climate action in 2023, citing its potential to help achieve decarbonization targets. Indeed, researchers said renewable capacity additions increased nearly 50% in 2023 to a total of 510 gigawatts. The agency said this was the highest observed rate over the past two decades.

"The idea of using pre-assembled components in housebuilding is Modern tech-enabled versions of modular housing promise a faster, more sustainable solution to housing crises, according to experts. But the sector has seen better adoption in some countries compared to others where it has failed to scale — such as the U.K. Prefabrication has existed in many forms, from the Fast forward a century and entire modules can be built in factories to then be combined to create houses in The fact that modular housing is also made in a controlled factory environment means less waste is generated, while also resulting in more Building entire sections in one place also means fewer delivery trips to sites, Shepherd explained. A 2022 Another study by academics at the University of Cambridge and Edinburgh Napier University, published in 2022, found that modular home construction can result in Despite these benefits, the sector has seen a number of setbacks in recent years and it remains relatively nascent in the U.K. and U.S. In January, it was reported that U.K. firm Modulous had Jonatan Pinkse, professor of sustainable business at King's College London, highlighted that part of the challenge for modular construction firms is that they first have to spend money on building a factory in which to construct modules and then need to have the projects in the pipeline to pay for this investment. He suggested that this presented more difficulty when coupled with the headwinds that also affected the wider construction sector, including higher energy costs and interest rates, as well as a cost-of-living crisis in many nations prompting people to hold off on house buying. ""And if you then can't profit from a market that is actually going up, but instead is going down, then the problem is simply that [firms] can't earn back their money fast enough, and investors then lose their trust in the business model,"" Pinkse told CNBC. Pinkse was one of the co-authors on Suzanne Peters, who also co-authored the research and is a research associate at Alliance Manchester Business School, told CNBC that the construction sector more broadly is a ""very tough business"" with a higher amount of failures versus other industries. Provisional Similarly, Daniel Paterson, director of government affairs at Make UK Modular, said that the modular housing sector had faced a ""series of unfortunate events,"" as the industry had essentially only launched in the U.K. in its current format in 2016/17. He explained that firms then need around 18 months to build factories, meaning it wasn't long before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, along with the economic headwinds that followed. Perceptions based on previous versions of prefabrication was another issue, according to Richard Valentine-Selsey, head of European living research and consultancy at Savills Research. He told CNBC that, in the U.K., there is the ""1960s hangover from prefabrication and the kind of connotations that has with lower quality, things that don't last and all the kind of negative impacts of that from the building boom post-war."" In addition, he said that the ""construction industry is quite a conservative beast and finds it very challenging at times to change and think forward and innovate unless their forced to do it, which has kind of led to flirtation with new methods but no kind of wholesale change towards delivering using modular."" Sweden and Japan are the countries cited as By comparison, a Make UK Modular In Sweden, one of the major players in this space is BoKlok, which is jointly owned by construction firm Skanska and homes and furniture company Ikea, and has been around since the mid-1990s. Shepherd pointed out that Sweden is also ""not a country where you can build 12 months of the year."" ""They have very deep winters with limited daylight, so there is an incentive to look at an alternative construction process to keep people working all year, to get houses delivered at the volume needed,"" he explained. Valentine-Selsey said that in Japan there was also a difference in the approach to residential buildings. ""In Japan, the value of the building depreciates over about 30 years, so by the end of that you kind of knock it down and rebuild it because it is worthless,"" he explained, making new building methods useful, given that the delivery of new homes is higher. Looking at these examples, could methods such as modular help tackle the U.K.'s affordable housing shortage? The current U.K. government has the target of building 300,000 homes a year, but ""That's 300,000 houses a year, and there is zero chance … of that happening if there is not some form different approach adopted,"" Shepherd said. Looking ahead, Valentine-Selsey said he was an ""optimist"" in his outlook for the modular sector. ""I think we're probably going to see an uptake again over the next five to 10 years,"" he said.

"In this article Investor demand for exchange-traded funds is not slowing down, and firms without ETF offerings may risk losing business, according to one Goldman Sachs expert. Steve Sachs, global chief operating officer of Goldman's ETF Accelerator, notes that despite the time and resources required to launch an ETF, not offering current and new investment strategies as ETFs may prove even more costly. ""Any number of our clients would tell you, the opportunity cost of not [offering ETF products] is greater,"" he recently told CNBC's If a firm does not have ETF offerings, Sachs thinks ""eventually those assets are going to leave and go to a competitor that does."" To help clients through the process of launching their own ETF products, ""Our core institutional clients were calling and asking, 'How do we get into this ETF space? How do we deliver our strategy, active and otherwise, in an ETF wrapper?'"" he said. According to Sachs, client inquiries ""While we wouldn't call that a big boom, it was certainly a catalyst. The idea was it made it easier to launch an ETF, but it didn't make it easy,"" Sachs said. ""At one point, we had more than 41 clients that had called us with exactly the same problem: 'How do I do this, how do I move quickly and can you help us?'"" It can still take years to build the expertise, headcount and risk management framework necessary to launch an ETF, said Sachs. That is where Goldman's accelerator platform aims to help. ""[It] allows our clients to come in, launch, list and manage their own ETF — but do it off of the technology, infrastructure and risk management expertise that Goldman's known for and essentially get to market faster and cheaper than they could do it on their own,"" Sachs said. Since its inception, the accelerator has facilitated the launch of five ETFs. The most recent is Other ETFs launched through the accelerator include ""GMO, Brandes [and] Eagle Capital all felt that the journey to build it on their own would be too expensive and too long,"" Sachs said.

"BEIJING — Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi said Thursday it will sell its first car for far less than Tesla's Model 3, as price wars heat up in China's fiercely competitive electric car market. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss. Tesla's Model 3 starts at Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3's 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday. Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi's car factory, for which all ""key"" steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational. Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has Tesla BYD Nio Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event. Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price. The SU7 supports Apple's Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August. Tesla's Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company's ""Full Self Driving"" for city streets has yet to be released in the country. Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the ""Max"" version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche's Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan. The SU7 is part of Xiaomi's recently launched ""Human x Car x Home"" strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company's revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products. Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.

"<p><em>By Brian McGlinchey via <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/world-war-ii-didnt-end-the-great"">Stark Realities</a></em></p>

<p>A principal <a href=""https://starkrealities.substack.com/about"" rel="""">goal</a> of <em>Stark Realities</em> is to “expose fundamental myths across the political spectrum” — and <strong>few myths are as universally embraced as the notion that US participation in World War II lifted the American economy out of the Great Depression</strong>.</p>

<p>This myth is dangerous not only because it leads citizens and politicians to see a bright side of war that doesn’t really exist, but also because <strong>it helps foster a belief that government spending is essential to countering economic downturns</strong>. That belief, in turn, has helped propel us to a point where the national debt now exceeds $34.6 trillion, with interest payments alone on pace to reach $1 trillion a year in 2026, inviting <a href=""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/cbo-director-warns-debt-market-meltdown-us-debt-unprecedented-trajectory"" rel="""">financial catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>In part, the wartime-prosperity myth springs from the fact that, during conflict on the scale of World War II, broad, macroeconomic <strong>measures like gross national product (GNP) and the unemployment rate are completely untethered from the economy’s most important facet: the standard of living</strong> enjoyed — or endured— by everyday people.</p>

<p>Between 1940 and 1944, real GNP rose at an unprecedented <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">13%</a> annual clip. Using GNP alone, one would think the war delivered a major improvement in the standard of living, with Americans enjoying a greater abundance of goods, accompanied by a rise in quality, selection and affordability.</p>

<p>The reality was the exact opposite: <strong>Americans endured rationing, shortages, declining product quality, and the outright unavailability of many new goods</strong>, such as cars, trucks and stoves. This was the inevitable result of factories and raw materials being redirected from the creation of things consumers want to building things like tanks and fighter planes that do nothing whatsoever to improve people’s lives (setting aside the separate issue of the war’s justness).</p>

<p>In many respects, <strong>America experienced an outright economic devolution</strong>. In the preceding century, industrialization and the division of labor led to enormous increases in productivity. During World War II, however, shortages motivated people who’d contentedly relied on farmers to start growing their own food and canning it. The scarcity of new clothing led homemakers to redirect time and energy to sewing their own garments and resewing them to stretch as much use out them as possible.</p>

<p>“Those remaining on the home front were forced to produce for themselves what they had previously been able to purchase,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">wrote</a> Steven Horwitz and Michael J. McPhillips. <strong>“The household again became a center of production rather than consumption alone.”</strong></p>

<p>GNP wasn’t the only measure falsely signaling wartime prosperity; employment numbers from the era were likewise misleading. The US unemployment rate plummeted from <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">17%</a> in 1939 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">1.2%</a> in 1944. Note, however, that military service members are not considered part of the labor force — which means that the draft extracted <a href=""https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers"" rel="""">11.5</a> million men from the denominator in the unemployment rate calculation.</p>

<p>Another 6.3 million volunteered, though many signed up because they preferred to secure a role they favored rather than face the chance of being drafted as an infantryman.</p>

<p>While it’s true that draftees and volunteers were “employed” by the armed forces, <strong>all these millions of men — no matter how noble their overseas missions may have been — weren’t doing anything to create prosperity at home</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the war machine didn’t demand laborers. With so many able men taken out of the economy, the slack was taken up by teenagers, women and retirees, many who’d have preferred to be doing other things.</p>

<p>In a growing economy, more people are producing goods and services, and elevating standards of living in the process. That was far from the case during World War II. <strong>Factories were humming, but they were making bayonets, bombs and battleships. </strong>“Four-tenths of the total labor force was not being used to produce consumer goods or capital capable of yielding consumer goods in the future,” noted <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=138"" rel="""">Robert Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>Defying conventional wisdom about “wartime prosperity,” <strong>Americans’ standard of living suffered tremendously from their government’s entry into World War II</strong>. In <em><a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">The Reality of the Wartime Economy</a></em>, Horwitz and McPhillips tapped some interesting source material to bring the grim economic realities of American life during World War II into sharp focus.</p>

<p>For example, a series of newspaper ads placed by Canton Electric Light &amp; Power Company — a local New York State utility — present <strong>a vivid, time-lapse portrayal of rapidly declining conditions following the December 1941 declaration of war</strong>:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Foreshadowing anticipated shortages, a March 17, 1942 ad for appliances is headlined “You Can Still Buy Them.” The ad includes a qualifier that’s upbeat while still signaling creeping scarcity: “We have a fairly good supply.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Just two months later, Canton Electric’s ad says “Now Is The Time” to buy various appliances and equipment, warning that “production of most of these items has stopped and only the supply in your dealers’ stock is available.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another two months later, a July 1942 ad indicates that some items that were briefly not available are back in inventory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In November of that first year of America’s World War II participation, Canton Electric switched to warning consumers that, “due to the war emergency, it is quite impossible to get replacement motors for civilian use,” and urging them to ensure they’re properly maintaining their “stokers and oil burners.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Later that same month, Canton Electric punted on advancing its retail business altogether, instead using its ad space to encourage readers to grow their own food, eat everything on their plates and comply with ration-stamp rules.</p>

<p>Horwitz and McPhillips also drew on <a href=""https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_17_03_01_horwitz.pdf"" rel="""">letters</a> written between 1942 and 1945 by Saidee Leach to her son serving in the Pacific. Contrary to the image of prosperity supposedly indicated by leaping GNP or plummeting unemployment, she tells him of:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Conserving scarce home-heating fuel during the coldest days by wearing fur coats indoors and residing only in their kitchen</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Having her typewriter seized by the government, and now using a lesser model she acquired from a Howard Johnson “which had to close due to the ban on pleasure driving.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Making an Easter dinner centered on fried Spam, because she “could not get fresh meat of any kind,” and later noting that “potatoes have entirely disappeared”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Local farmers refusing to sell their turkey flocks for Thanksgiving meals at the prices set by the Office of Price Administration — illustrating the folly of government price controls.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>That is not the picture of an economy delivered from the Great Depression. Rather, <strong>“World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services,”</strong> wrote <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">Peter Ferrara</a>. “The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.”</p>

<p><strong>America’s postwar experience presents another pointed contradiction of the myth</strong> of wartime prosperity.</p>

<p>As the war’s end grew closer, <strong>Keynesian economists unanimously predicted peace would bring economic disaster.</strong> For example, Paul Samuelson <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">said</a> America would experience “the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.” </p>

<p>Alvin Hansen <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">warned</a> that the economy must be kept on a centrally-controlled wartime footing, even in peacetime: ""When the war is over, the government cannot just disband the Army, close down munitions factories, stop building ships, and remove all economic control.”</p>
<a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5""><picture><figure role=""group"" class=""caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images""><img alt="""" data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""6dd2baf0-ab41-42f4-97ee-da668deeb08e"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""284"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/samuelson.jpeg?itok=Mzu1UMN5"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" width=""500"" /><figcaption><strong>Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, who predicted peace would bring economic disaster, taught Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, who predicted the internet's impact would be akin to that of the fax machine</strong></figcaption></figure></picture></a>

<p>However, that’s pretty much what happened — and <strong>Hansen, Samuelson and their fellow economic flat-Earthers couldn’t have been more wrong</strong> about the consequences. “The year 1946, when civilian output increased by about 30 percent, was the most glorious single year in the entire history of the U.S. economy,” wrote <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">Higgs</a>.</p>

<p>This <strong>despite the fact that</strong> <strong>government purchases of goods and services collapsed by <a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">68%</a></strong> between the second quarter of 1945 and the first quarter of 1946 — and upwards of a <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/11/30/the-great-depression-was-ended-by-the-end-of-world-war-ii-not-the-start-of-it/?sh=486423c657d3"" rel="""">million</a> civilian government employees were laid off and millions of service members discharged.</p>

<p>As war-fighting men poured back into civilian life, millions of women withdrew from the labor force, contentedly returning to duty as mothers and home managers. Rather than soaring as predicted by the “experts,” unemployment merely edged higher, from 1.9% in 1945 to <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">3.9%</a> in 1947.</p>

<p>“Less than a year and a half after VJ-day,” <a href=""https://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=109"" rel="""">crowed</a> President Truman, “more than 10 million demobilized veterans and other millions of wartime workers have found employment in <strong>the swiftest and most gigantic change-over that any nation has ever made from war to peace.”</strong> (Note this happened despite — and in part <em><a href=""https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae5_2_1_2.pdf"" rel="""">because of</a></em> — Truman’s failure to institute a higher minimum wage as the war ended.)</p>

<p>Having been proven enormously wrong about the economic implications of peace, <strong>Keynesians scrambled to credit the war with enabling the postwar boom</strong>, arguing that it was fueled by people drawing down savings accumulated while the supply of consumer goods was sharply restricted. However, as Higgs determined by studying the data of the time, “Holdings of liquid assets <a href=""https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=2337"" rel="""">did not decline at all</a> after the war. People financed their spending for consumer goods by reducing their saving rate.”</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth, it was only after World War II that — <strong>free from the government’s commandeering of factories, workers and resources</strong>, and saddled with fewer price controls and other federal market intrusions — America was finally able to emerge from the Great Depression.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t know that if you evaluated the economy’s health using Keynesians’ preferred measure. Just as the GNP gauge provided a 180-degree misreading of wartime economic realities, it failed in similarly spectacular fashion during the postwar boom: From 1945 to 1947, GNP plummeted 22%.</p>

<p>In addition to further illuminating the shortfalls of aggregate economic measures, <strong>America’s postwar economic experience delivered another broadside to the myth of World War II-fostered prosperity</strong>, and to the idea that government spending, central planning and market interventions are essential to economic achieving economic recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Thirty major central banks are expected to cut rates in the second half of 2024, a year when more than seventy nations will have elections, which often means massive increases in government spending. </strong>Additionally, the latest inflation figures show stubbornly persistent consumer price annualized growth.</p>

<p>In the United States, headline PCE inflation in February will likely grow by 0.4%, compared with a 0.3% rise in January, and consensus expects a 2.5% annualized rate, up from 2.4% in January. This is on top of the already 20% accumulated inflation of the past four years. Core inflation will likely show a 0.3% gain, according to Bloomberg Economics, which means an annualized 2.8%, building on top of the price increases of the past years.</p>

<p>Thirty central banks easing and seventy national governments increasing spending in an election year means more fuel for the inflation fire in a year in which money supply growth has bounced significantly from its 2023 lows.</p>

<p><strong>Central banks ignored monetary aggregates when they shrugged off the risk of inflation in 2020, and now they are, again, easing way too fast when the battle against inflation has not finished. </strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, the only real tool that central banks have used is hiking rates, because different parallel measures of money growth, including reverse repo liquidity injections, have kept money supply growth at an elevated rate even when the balance of the G7 central banks was moderating, albeit at a slower pace than announced.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting rates may come too late because, by the time it is implemented, it will cause a double negative.</strong></p>

<p>Government deficits will be cheaper to refinance, bloating an already record-high public debt yet again, but those cuts may have little impact on small and medium enterprises and families because they suffer significantly more from the accumulated effects of inflation, which means weaker margins, more difficulties to make ends meet, and impoverishment.</p>

<p><strong>We must also remember that these persistent levels of official inflation come after relevant tweaks in the calculation of the consumer price index. </strong>We certainly know one thing: consumers do not pay attention to the annualized rate of growth in prices, but to the accumulated level of destruction of their purchasing power, and everyone, from Europeans to Americans, knows that they have become artificially poorer by the insane fiscal and monetary policies implemented in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody who takes inflation seriously would even consider easing in an election year, adding trillions of dollars of deficit spending to the fire of inflation. Furthermore, the history of inflation warns us about giving up easily and too fast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fed is making a big mistake by cheering the headline economic figures that come from disguising a private sector recession with a massive increase in public debt and weakening employment figures embellished by temporary jobs and public sector hiring. </strong>Additionally, it is making a mistake by giving dovish signals that make market participants take more risk. There has been no relevant reduction in the money supply if we include the different layers of liquidity injections. Announcing forthcoming rate cuts will certainly make speculative debt rise but will hardly change the credit demand from the backbone of the economy, small businesses, and families. Since the US government has rejected any calls for normalization and instead added more deficits and debt as if rising bond yields were not a problem, citizens and businesses have already suffered greatly from ongoing inflation and rate increases. As such, the rate cuts will help an already bloated government spending and the zombie corporations that keep access to capital markets. Everyone else will be hurt both ways, with inflation and lower access to credit.</p>

<p><strong>You may think all the above problems are policy mistakes, but they are not. This is a slow process of nationalizing resources</strong>. Inflation and artificial money creation through deficits and monetization are a gradual transfer of wealth from real salaries and deposit savings to the government. You are basically becoming poorer to sustain an ever-increasing government size. The next time you read that massive deficits and monetary easing are good policies for the middle class, ask yourself why you find it harder each year to pay for goods and services. The mistakes made in 2020–2024 will cost the middle class many more taxes, even if the government promises it will only be “taxes on the rich,” the oldest gimmick to raise your taxes.</p>

<p><strong>More taxes, persistent inflation, the hidden tax, and the loss of value of your wages. That is “easing” for you. A private sector recession with headline economic figures bloated by government debt. The recipe for stagflation.</strong></p>

<p>With gold hitting yet another awe-inspiring all-time high in the wake of Powell’s remarks reassuring markets (more or less) to expect rate cuts in 2024, <strong>a few analysts are pointing out risk factors for a correction - so is there really still room to run?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-steady-may-face-correction-risks-6a24bf45"">Wall Street Journal</a> points out that <strong>oil price spikes</strong> driven by the acceleration of war in the Middle East <strong>could cause the Fed to reverse its position of cutting rates three times</strong> this year - <strong>especially as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has reached historic lows.</strong></p>

<p>Since Biden took office, the SPR has been drained by over 40% — ironically, as part of a desperate gambit to keep oil prices artificially low in the face of its proxy war in Ukraine and out-of-control inflation, which can only get even worse after the Fed cuts rates. Now that <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-admin-cancels-plan-to-refill-emergency-oil-reserve-amid-high-prices"">the SPR won’t be refilled as expected</a> (itself a taxpayer-funded sale), <strong>Americans will feel even more of the inflationary reality when they head to the gas pumps.</strong></p>

<p>For context, the SPR was founded in 1975 and is now hovering at levels not seen since the early 80’s:</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcsstus1&amp;f=a"">https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcsstus1&amp;f=a</a></em></p>

<p><strong>But as the conflict in Gaza and beyond continues to accelerate, the US will find more excuses to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/middle-east-uncertainty-and-its-effects-on-global-markets/"">expand its own involvement</a> as it has from the start. </strong></p>

<p>Whatever form the meddling takes, the US will inevitably need to finance it by printing money. So, as usual, the Fed is damned if they do and damned if they don’t, defeated by their own games: they need to finance the Middle East meddling with money printing, but both the money printing required to fund the war <em>and </em>the effects of the war itself will work together to drive oil prices up.</p>

<p><strong>Coincidentally, both factors will also work together to push gold to hit fresh all-time highs this year, </strong>unless the Fed decides to buck the Military-Industrial Complex and renege on its rate cut promises, making it much more challenging for Biden administration war hawks to keep the US involved to the extent they’d like.</p>

<p><strong>On the same topic of Russia and the Middle East, the BRICS countries’ continuing de-dollarization efforts mean that we can expect them to <a href=""https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/world-gold-council-blistering-central-bank-buying-fuels-strong-gold-demand/"">keep stockpiling gold</a> as they continue to divest from petrodollar dependence. </strong>Russia says they’ll be <a href=""https://watcher.guru/news/brics-russia-doubles-gold-foreign-currencies-to-uproot-us-dollar""><em>doubling </em>their gold</a> and foreign currency purchases, and China’s central bank just hit a new reported record high for its gold reserves late last month.</p>

<p>Still, some are skeptical, saying that gold and other metals are overbought and due for a correction, and interpreted Powell’s remarks on Wednesday as mildly hawkish. <strong>Powell did say that more progress needs to be made on inflation in order for the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. These statements added a dash of uncertainty for some:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down towards 2 percent…Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even as Powell admitted the fight against inflation is “not done” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtsdkIlHeA"">an epic understatement</a>), <strong>markets were reassured that the Fed is still expecting to lower interest rates, saying that the data doesn’t justify changing the current course:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is gold too overbought, or does the macro environment provide enough upward pressure to give it room to keep running?</p>

<p><strong>While short-term corrections are always something to consider during such dramatic price-run ups, I’d call them buying opportunities. </strong></p>

<p>And if the mainstream media’s reaction is to be used as a barometer, the true reality of what the skyrocketing price of gold truly means for the economy and the US dollar still hasn’t been priced in. As Peter Schiff tweeted earlier this week:</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"">
<p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"" xml:lang=""en"">The mainstream media has finally noticed <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/gold?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#gold</a>, but has no idea why it's rising, or has any appreciation for how high it's going. They're also not encouraging anyone to buy it. All of this is a good sign that the rally still has a long way to go before any meaningful correction.</p>

<script async="""" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>The more skeptical analyses acknowledge that it will be <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gold-bulls-eye-more-record-highs-despite-lightning-gains-2024-04-05/"">an uphill battle</a> for it to sustain the same awe-inspiring upward pace that it has had since the start of the year. But even they, like I, <strong>still expect a confluence of factors in 2024 to continue pushing it higher.</strong></p>

But he also said the timing isn't certain and policymakers need more evidence that inflation is moving toward the Fed's 2% goal. Since then, other officials have echoed those comments. They see an unspecified number of rate reductions coming but the timing is uncertain. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he thinks there could be just one cut this year, though his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee have indicated three. Markets expect the Fed to start down the path of easing in June or July, with a total of three cuts coming by the end of 2024. Read more Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

"Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Tuesday she still expects interest rate cuts this year, but ruled out the next policy meeting in May. Mester also indicated that the long-run path is higher than policymakers had previously thought. Her fellow policymaker, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, also said Tuesday she expects cuts this year but not until there's more convincing evidence that inflation has been subdued. The central bank official noted progress made on inflation while the economy has continued to grow. Should that continue, rate cuts are likely, though she didn't offer any guidance on timing or extent. ""I continue to think that the most likely scenario is that inflation will continue on its downward trajectory to 2 percent over time. But I need to see more data to raise my confidence,"" Mester said in prepared remarks for a speech in Cleveland. Additional inflation readings will provide clues as to whether some higher-than-expected data points this year either were temporary blips or a sign that the progress on inflation ""is stalling out,"" she added. ""I do not expect I will have enough information by the time of the FOMC's next meeting to make that determination,"" Mester said. Those remarks come nearly two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to Mester's comments would seem to rule out a cut at the April 30-May 1 FOMC meeting, a sentiment also reflected in market pricing. Mester is a voting member of the FOMC but will leave in June after having served the 10-year limit. Futures traders expect the Fed to start easing in June and to cut by three-quarters of a percentage point by the end of the year. San Francisco Fed President Daly said that three reductions this year is a ""very reasonable baseline"" though she said nothing is guaranteed. Daly also is an FOMC voter this year. ""Three rate cuts is a projection, and a projection is not a promise,"" she said, later adding, ""We're getting there, but it's not going to be tomorrow, but it's not going to be forever."" While looking for rate cuts, Mester said she thinks the long-run federal funds rate will be higher than the long-standing expectation of 2.5%. The rate is considered the level where policy is neither restrictive nor stimulative. After the March meeting, the long-rate rate projection moved up to 2.6%, indicating there are other members leaning higher. Mester noted the rate was very low when the Covid pandemic hit and gave the Fed little wiggle room to boost the economy. ""At this point, we are seeking to calibrate our policy well to economic developments so we can avoid having to act in an aggressive fashion,"" she said.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Speaking specifically about stronger-than-expected price pressures to start the year, the central bank leader said he and his fellow officials are in no rush to ease monetary policy. ""On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,"" Powell said in remarks ahead of a question-and-answer session at Stanford University. ""We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent,"" he added. ""Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy."" The remarks come two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold benchmark short-term borrowing rates steady. In addition, the committee's post-meeting statement on March 20 included the ""greater confidence"" qualifier needed before cutting. Markets widely expect the FOMC to start easing policy this year, though they have had to recalibrate their outlook for the timing and extent of cuts as inflation has held stubbornly higher. Other economic variables, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending, have held up as well, giving the Fed time to assess the current state of affairs before moving. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ""Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,"" Powell said. ""The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path."" Other Fed officials speaking this week have made remarks consistent with the Fed's patient approach. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic Powell reiterated that decisions are being made ""meeting by meeting"" and noted only that cuts are ""likely to be appropriate ... at some point this year."" The uncertainty about rates has caused some consternation in markets, with stocks falling sharply earlier this week as Treasury yields moved higher. The market stabilized Wednesday, but traders in the fed funds futures market again repriced their rate expectations, casting some doubt on a June cut as the market-implied probability moved to about 54% at one point, according to CME Group data. Along with his comments on rates, Powell spent some time discussing Fed independence. With the presidential election campaign heating up, Powell noted the importance of steering clear of political issues. ""Our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public,"" he said. ""We will not always get it right — no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term — and nothing else."" He also talked about ""mission creep,"" specifically as it relates to some demand for the Fed to get involved in climate change issues and the preparations financial institutions take for related events. ""We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,"" he said. Correction: Powell's remarks come two weeks after the Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold rates steady.

"The annual two-day ""SEC Speaks"" event kicked off Tuesday, offering clues to what the priorities will be for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming year. Sponsored by the Practising Law Institute, it is a forum where the SEC provides guidance to the legal community on rules, regulations, enforcement actions and lawsuits. The event allows the SEC to get its main messages across, and this year a key issue is ""disclosure."" ""[W]e have an obligation to update the rules of the road, always with an eye toward promoting trust as well as efficiency, competition, and liquidity in the markets,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in his introduction to the conference. Besides Gensler, all the SEC division heads and senior staff will be speaking. Based on Gensler's introductory remarks, there will be discussions about the upcoming move to shorten the securities settlement cycle from two days to one (T+1, which takes place May 28), the expansion of the definition of an exchange to include more recent trading platforms (like request-for-quote, or RFQ, electronic trading platforms), consideration of a change in the current one-penny increment for quoting stock trades to sub-penny levels, creation of a best execution standard for broker-dealers, and creation of more competition for individual investors orders (so-called payment for order flow). You often hear SEC officials say the role of the SEC is to ""protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation."" That sounds like a pretty broad mandate, and it is. Deliberately so. It came out of the disaster of the 1929 stock market crash, which was the initial event in the greatest economic catastrophe of the last 100 years: the Great Depression. Prior to 1933, and particularly in the 1920s, all sorts of securities were sold to the public with wild claims behind them, much of which were fraudulent. After the crash of 1929, Congress went looking for a cause, and fraudulent claims and lack of disclosure were high on the list. Congress then passed the Securities Act of 1933, and the following year passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC to enforce all the new laws. It also required everyone involved in the securities business (mainly brokerage firms and stock exchanges) to register with the SEC. The 1933 Act did not make it illegal to sell a bad investment. It simply required disclosure: all relevant facts about an investment were supposed to be disclosed, and investors could make up their own minds. The 1933 Act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities in the United States. This was followed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulated mutual funds (and eventually ETFs), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which required investment advisers to register with the SEC. Tuesday's conference is a chance for Gensler and his staff to tell everyone what they are doing in greater detail. The agency has six divisions, but they can be boiled down to disclosure, risk monitoring and enforcement. Risk monitoring. Disclosure. There's also a division of examinations that conducts the SEC's National Exam Program. It's just what it sounds like. The SEC identifies areas of high concern (cybersecurity, crypto, money laundering, climate change, etc.) and then monitors Corporate America (investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, etc.) to make sure they are in compliance with all the required disclosures. Current hot topics include climate change, crypto and cybersecurity. The problem is that the definition of what should be disclosed has evolved over the decades. For example, there is a bitter legal fight brewing over the recent enactment of regulations requiring companies to disclose climate risks. Many contend this was not part of the original SEC mandate. The SEC disagrees, arguing it is part of the mandate to ""protect investors."" Enforcement. These are the cops. They conduct investigations into securities laws violations, and they prosecute the civil suits in the federal courts. This division will be providing an update on the litigation the SEC is involved in, which is growing. Mutual funds, ETFs and investment advisers. Trading. Donald Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the SEC in January considerably tightened the rules around disclosure of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Trump's company, Truth Social, went public on March 22 through a merger with a SPAC known as Digital World Acquisition Corp. It is now trading as Prior to the recent rule changes, executives marketing a company to be acquired by a SPAC often made wild claims about the future profitability of these businesses — claims that would never have been possible to make had a traditional initial public offering route been used. The new SPAC rules that the SEC adopted made the target company legally liable for any statement made about future results by assuming responsibility for disclosures. Additionally, companies are provided with a ""safe harbor"" protection when they make forward-looking statements, which provide them with protection against certain legal liabilities. However, IPOs are not afforded this ""safe harbor"" protection, which is why forward-looking statements in an IPO registration are usually very cautiously worded. The rules clarified that SPACs also do not have ""safe harbor"" legal protections for forward-looking statements, which means the companies could more easily be sued. Like I said, Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the message: ""Disclosure!"" will likely be the dominant refrain.

A significant number also say they feel worse-off financially than their parents, and are pessimistic about their children's financial futures, the In the U.S., Australia, Spain and Mexico, around 70% of adults said they were ""very or somewhat stressed"" about money. The percentage reduced slightly to 63% in the U.K., 57% in Germany, 55% in Switzerland, and roughly half of people in Singapore and France. Across those countries, between a half and two thirds of people said they considered themselves to be part of the middle class — except in the U.K., where it was a lower 37%.

"BEIJING — Chinese electric car company Since November, Nio has partnered with at least four Chinese automakers — Changan, Geely, Chery and JAC — for developing battery swap standards and expanding the network in China. All these efforts are aimed at alleviating consumers' anxiety about driving range. While having a large network of battery charging stations helps address those concerns, battery swapping is a faster method as it takes only a few minutes. ""Swapping right now is mainly driven by Nio. Of course, Nio found out this is an ecosystem,"" CLSA's deputy head of research Ding Luo said in an interview. ""If only one player is trying to build up the whole ecosystem, it's impossible for [them]. That's why they're thinking whether they can invite some partners."" Battery swapping still isn't mainstream because the car batteries need to be standardized, he added. While a charging station resembles a typical gas station, battery-swap technology is housed in a shed-like structure. It uses machines to automatically exchange depleted batteries for pre-charged ones in compatible cars. Nio said in mid-March that it completed 40 million battery swaps compared with nearly 37 million charges at its public stations — Nio consumers can also access third-party charging stations, or install one at home. ""I think our outlook is very simple,"" Shen Fei, senior vice president of Nio's power division, said in Chinese translated by CNBC. ""The first thing is to serve Nio's users, and then provide a good battery charging and swapping experience, make charging more convenient than refueling, and at the same time help the company sell more cars."" The company claims that with battery swap, drivers can get a fresh charge in three minutes, if they opt in for a Shen said more car models will be added to Nio's battery swap network, while adding that swapping can allow drivers to keep abreast with improvements in battery technology. Power services and other products account for just about 10% of Nio's total revenue. The company said that category of ""other sales"" for 2023 grew by 69% to 6.36 billion yuan ($895.9 million). Nio does not break out swap station revenue. Battery swapping has been tried by the industry with mixed success, especially in the U.S. Tesla and a startup called Better Space tried out swapping more than 10 years ago, but the venture soon closed. In 2021, another startup, While it's not clear how much headway Ample has made in the U.S., the company has since expanded its partnerships overseas. Last month the company announced it would serve ""For swapping to work it can't be niche,"" Tu Le, head of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said. ""Battery inventory investment is massive, so it needs to be amortized over lots of swapping."" But he was cautious on whether Nio could sell enough of its own premium-priced cars to make the economics work. ""For now I still think the combination of swapping and charging makes for a pretty attractive feature set, but swapping alone likely doesn't help them sell that many more cars."" ""I think the nudge the Chinese government gave to encourage others to join forces with Nio on swapping could create the necessary pool of vehicles to make swapping viable,"" he added. Nio is the first major electric car company to roll out battery swap stations in addition to charging stations, alongside its own vehicles in mainland China and The company has installed more than 2,300 battery swap stations, and plans to install 1,000 more this year. Nio's investment in battery swap stations is about two years ahead of market demand, CEO William Li said last month, adding that less than a fifth of battery swap stations that Nio operates are processing 60 orders a day, likely the minimum orders needed for a station to break even. Nio's battery charging stations, on the other hand, reached profitability last year, according to the company. It plans to build 20,000 more this year. Passenger car battery swap stations can cost around $500,000 to build, while a relatively basic charging station with two ports costs around $200,000 to $300,000, according to Shay Natarajan, a North America-based partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund that invests in transportation. CLSA's Luo said businesses also prefer to invest in normal charging stations than swap stations because they make a higher return. But if businesses want to install faster-charging stations, he said they might face power grid challenges. CLSA's analysis found that the power required for five superchargers in one location would be more than what 300 families would normally consume. Tesla is also collaborating with automakers in battery charging, with its over 50,000 superchargers worldwide that claim to restore about two-thirds of a battery's charge in 15 minutes. In February, Ford reached a deal that allows its electric cars to The rapid development of electric cars, ostensibly aimed at reducing carbon emissions, also raises questions about battery waste. Nio pointed out that recent growth of new energy vehicles, which include hybrids, means nearly 20 million batteries will be reaching the end of their eight-year warranty period between 2025 and 2032. Last month, the company announced a partnership with battery giant Nio claimed that by using battery swap and big data, it can retain 80% of a battery's capacity after 12 years of use. Nio also said last month that CATL will develop batteries with longer lives for the company. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Michael Wayland contributed to this report.

"BEIJING — China's real estate troubles are likely far from over and industry problems need to be addressed quickly if overall GDP growth is to pick up significantly, according to a report released Thursday by global investment firm KKR. That's one of the two key takeaways from a recent trip to China by the firm's head of global and macro asset allocation, Henry H. McVey. It was his fourth visit in just over a year. ""A fundamentally overbuilt real estate industry needs to be addressed — and quickly,"" he said in the report, which counts Changchun Hua, KKR's chief economist for Greater China, among the co-authors. ""Second, confidence must be restored to drive savings back down,"" McVey said, noting that would spur consumers and businesses to spend on upgrading to higher quality products, as Chinese authorities have promoted. Real estate and related sectors once accounted for about one fifth or more of China's economy, depending on the breadth of analysts' calculations. The property industry has slumped in the last few years after Beijing's crackdown on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Based on comparisons to housing corrections in the U.S., Japan and Spain, China's ""housing market correction may be just halfway complete"" in terms of its depth, the KKR report said. ""Both price and volume must come under pressure to finish the cleansing cycle,"" the report said. ""To date, though, it has largely been a contraction in volume."" While KKR's report didn't provide much detail on expectations for specific real estate policy, the authors said more action by Beijing to improve China's real estate sector ""could materially shift investor perception."" Amid geopolitical tensions, the country's property market slump and ""According to some of our proprietary survey work, many allocators have considered reducing China exposure to 5-6%, down from 10-12% today at a time that we think fundamentals in the economy are likely bottoming,"" the KKR report said. Much of official Chinese data to start the year beat analysts' expectations. Chinese officials have said the real estate sector remains in a period of adjustment, while Beijing shifts its emphasis Authorities have also released policies to promote financial support for select property developers, while many local governments — though not necessarily the largest cities — have significantly relaxed home purchase restrictions. KKR expects a modest slowdown in China's GDP growth to 4.7% this year, and 4.5% next year, with real estate and Covid-related factors halving their drag on the economy from 1.4 percentage points in 2024 to a 0.7 percentage point drag in 2025. ""Our bottom line is that: with the ongoing [property] correction as well as some potential further policy support, we think the drag to [the] overall economy should moderate a bit over the next few years,"" McVey said in a separate statement. He is also chief investment officer of KKR Balance Sheet. Catering, accommodation and wholesale are set to modestly increase their contribution to growth in the next two years, while digitalization and the shift toward more carbon-neutral, green industry are expected to remain the largest drivers of growth, according to the report. For investors, the report said a more important development than China's GDP increase would be whether authorities could make it easier for businesses and households to tap capital markets. ""Repairing soft spots in [the] economy, especially around housing, will ultimately improve the cost of capital, and will also allow new consumer companies to access the capital markets likely at better prices if real estate and confidence are doing better,"" McVey said in the statement. Beijing in March announced a GDP target of around 5% for this year. Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said last month that developers Recent data have pointed to some stabilization in the property sector slowdown. The seven-day-moving average of new home sales in 21 major cities fell by 34.5% year-on-year as of Monday, better than the 45.3% drop recorded a week earlier, according to Nomura, citing Wind Information. Compared with the same period in 2019, that sales average was only down by 27.8% as of Monday, versus a 47% drop a week earlier, Nomura said, noting most of the improvement was in China's biggest cities. KKR said most of its local portfolio is in consumer and services companies, whose business reflect how Chinese people in the middle to higher income range are spending modestly to upgrade their lifestyles. ""Top line growth is solid, margins are holding, and consumers are spending on less conspicuous items such as 'smart homes,' pets, and recreational activities,"" the report said. ""Domestic travel is also strong."" Retail sales rose by a better-than-expected 5.5% Longer term, KKR still expects that China can follow historical precedent in changing policy to be ""more investor friendly."" ""While our message is not an all-clear signal to lean in,"" the report said, ""it is a reminder – using history as our guide – that, if China does adjust its domestic policies to be more investor friendly (especially as it relates to supply side reforms), this market could rebound significantly from current levels.""

"Decades of trade deficits and a strong dollar created too many ""losers"" in the U.S. economy who turned to Donald Trump's protectionist policies, according to Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute — and those conditions remain. Trump's ""America First"" economic policies led his administration to institute a slew of trade tariffs on China, Mexico, the European Union and others, including slapping 25% duties on imported steel and aluminum. As the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, Trump has proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a minimum levy of 60% on imported Chinese products. These policies have drawn widespread criticism from economists, who argue that tariffs are counterproductive, as they make imported goods more expensive for the average American. Speaking to CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Forum on Friday, Koo said protectionism was a ""horrible thing,"" but that Trump's approach ""does have some economic logic."" ""When we studied economics and free trade, in particular, we were taught...that free trade always creates both winners and losers in the same economy, but the gain that winners get is always greater than the loss of the losers, so the society as a whole always gains. So that's why the free trade is good,"" he noted. Koo nevertheless argued that this rests on the assumption that trade flows are balanced or in surplus, while the U.S. has been running huge deficits for the last forty years, which have expanded the number of ""losers."" ""By 2016, the number of people who consider themselves losers of free trade, were large enough to elect Trump president, and so we have to really go back and say to ourselves: what did we do wrong to allow this many people in United States to view themselves as losers of free trade?"" he said. For Koo, the key problem was the exchange rate, as the strength of the U.S. dollar incentivized foreign imports and hurt U.S. companies exporting around the world. ""We kind of let the exchange rate be decided by so-called market forces, speculators, my clients, Wall Street types, but the foreign exchange rate has to be set in a way that the number of losers does not grow to a point where the free trade itself is lost,"" Koo said. He pointed to a similar pivotal moment in 1985, when President Ronald Reagan faced the same issue of a strong dollar and rising protectionism. At the time, Reagan responded by facilitating the Plaza Accord with France, West Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom to depreciate the U.S. dollar against the respective currencies of these countries through intervention in the foreign exchange market. ""That's the kind of thing we should have been more conscious of doing. Instead of allowing [the] dollar to go wherever the market takes [it], and then these people who are not as fortunate as we are in the financial markets, end up suffering and end up voting for Mr. Trump,"" Koo added. He argued that economists need to move beyond the idea that the trade deficit is simply down to ""too much investment"" and ""too few savings"" in the U.S., as this means deficit can only be reduced by remaining in recession until domestic demand weakens so much that U.S. companies can export more goods, which would not be possible in a democracy. Koo again pointed to past dealings with Japan, suggesting that if the argument held that overseas companies are just filling in where U.S. companies cannot satisfy domestic demand, then the American companies fighting Japanese firms in the 1970s and 70s should have recorded huge profits due to excess demand. ""But that did not actually happen. It's the opposite that happened. So many of them went bankrupt, so many losers of free trade were left in the streets, because it was not savings and investment issue, it was the exchange rate issue,"" he said. ""The dollar should have been much weaker, and Reagan understood that that's why he took that action."" President Joe Biden's administration has also broken from Washington's decades-long spotlight on free trade deals and has retained any of the measures enacted under the Trump administration. However, rather than focus on imposing new tariffs, Biden has instead ",,2024-04-07,,"Free trade flaws fueled Trump's rise in 2016 — and the problems remain, top economist says"

"Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday that it's possible interest rates may have to move higher to control inflation, rather than the cuts her fellow officials have indicated are likely and that the market is expecting. Noting a number of potential upside risks to inflation, Bowman said policymakers need to be careful not to ease policy too quickly. ""While it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,"" she said in prepared remarks for a speech to a group of Fed watchers in New York. ""Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run."" As a member of the Board of Governors, Bowman is a permanent voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Since taking office in late 2018, her public speeches have put her on the more hawkish side of the FOMC, meaning she favors a more aggressive posture toward containing inflation. Bowman said her most likely outcome remains that ""it will eventually become appropriate to lower"" rates, though she noted that ""we are still not yet at the point"" of cutting as ""I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation."" The speech, to the Shadow Open Market Committee, comes with markets on edge about the near-term future of Fed policy. Statements this week from multiple officials, Futures traders are pricing in three cuts this year, though it has become a close call between June and July for when they start. FOMC members in March also penciled in three cuts this year, though one unidentified official in the ""dot plot"" indicated no decreases until 2026 and there was considerable dispersion otherwise about how aggressively the central bank would move. ""Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy,"" Bowman said. Weighing inflation risks, she said that supply-side improvements that helped bring numbers down this year may not have the same impact going forward. Moreover, she cited geopolitical risks and fiscal stimulus as other upside hazards, along with stubbornly higher housing prices and labor market tightness. ""Inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services,"" Bowman said. Fed officials will get their next look at inflation data Wednesday, when the Labor Department releases the March consumer price index report.

"Rent prices The monthly cost for a one-bedroom apartment across the U.S. bumped up to $1,487, a 0.3% increase from February. The price of a typical two-bedroom apartment also jumped 0.5% to $1,847, according to a While prices are up overall, some metro areas saw declines. For example, the rent price for a one-bedroom apartment in Baltimore, Maryland, is $1,390, down 0.7% from a year ago, per Zumper. Arizona is unique, with rent decreases in all the major metro areas assessed. On a statewide level, the median price for one-bedroom apartments declined to $1,311 in March, about a 4% decline from $1,365 a year ago, according to Zumper data. The broader rental market's slight increase in prices may be a reflection of old seasonal patterns, experts say. ""It's kind of expected,"" said Crystal Chen, a spokeswoman for Zumper. ""When we get to the warmer months, that's when demand picks up."" More from Personal Finance: ""During the colder months of the year … the rental market tends to be cool,"" said Jacob Channel, a senior economist at LendingTree. ""As we get closer and closer to summer, we start to see rent prices increase in more places."" Yet, some fundamental factors such as supply and demand may also be reflected, said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Some markets in the country are cooling more than others. Prices in the Sun Belt and the intermountain areas are coming down, and Arizona is a prime example, Chen said. Zumper defines the intermountain region as Arizona, Nevada and Colorado. ""All of the Arizona cities on our report either had flat or declining year-over-year rates,"" she said. The city of Glendale, for example, had the largest rent decline, with one-bedroom prices down over 10% from this time last year. Arizona has a lot of supply coming online, keeping rent prices down in the area, Wachter explained. ""In the data, there's some evidence of fundamentals at play, in addition to seasonality,"" she said. Phoenix is expected to add more than 33,000 new units available this year and many buildings in the state are offering concessions, such as waived deposits or application fees and up to two months of free rent, Zumper found. ""If you're in that market, it's a great time for renters to snag an amenity-rich apartment that would have been out of reach otherwise,"" Chen said. While more supply is expected to surge in the Sun Belt and the intermountain region, a lot of Midwestern and Northeast markets are undersupplied, making rent prices push upward. ""The supply coming online absolutely does vary by market,"" Wachter said. Rent prices for one-bedroom apartments are up 25% in New York City from a year ago, according to Zumper. Rent costs and high competition also plague areas such as Columbus, Ohio, and Norfolk, Virginia. Yet, while prices increased, they've significantly declined from a year ago and even more compared with the market volatility from 2021 and 2022, when pent-up demand kept prices high. ""Rent prices are going up and they are expensive, but it's not suddenly skyrocketing again,"" Channel said. ""We don't expect to see national rates spike at all like in 2021 and 2022,"" Chen said. ""The seasonality is coming back after two crazy years."" While many factors affect housing affordability in the U.S., the main one, in simplest terms, is poor supply, Channel said. ""The more rental units that are built, the lower prices are likely to go, and I think Arizona shows that really well,"" he said.

"If you miss a doctor's appointment these days, you could get hit with a "" This happened to me recently for the first time, and the charge was a steep $150. When I complained to friends and family, I learned that my experience wasn't unusual — most had dealt with a similar fee. I talked to experts and consumer advocates about why such fees are becoming common, if the charges are fair to patients and how to best avoid them. ""I very strongly support such fees,"" said ""Patients who don't show up are taking up appointments which other patients could use,"" said Loewenstein, adding that ""without such a fee, patients have little if any disincentive for not bothering to cancel appointments well in advance."" More from Personal Finance: Certified financial planner and physician ""If a patient doesn't show up, that costs the practice money,"" said McClanahan, a member of Caitlin Donovan, But, she said, ""to solve this problem is not to charge patients more fees, which many can't afford."" She has heard of medical offices having success with call and text reminders to patients about their appointments. Patients should always be given the opportunity to bow out, she said. That doesn't always happen. Earlier this month, my sister, Janna, tried to call her doctor twice to cancel her appointment for the next day. ""I was in elevator music purgatory for over 20 minutes,"" she said. Both times, she didn't get through to anyone. Three weeks later, she got a bill for a $100 ""no-show"" fee. For my appointment, I did get a call the day before from the doctor's office. But when I told the woman I'd forgotten about the appointment and couldn't make it, she said I'd still be charged a cancellation fee. Adam Rust ""But if penalty fees become a profit center, it may incentivize trickery and deception,"" Rust said. In addition to sufficient reminders and opportunities to cancel appointments for patients, there can be other creative alternatives to ""no-show"" fees, Donovan said. She recently spoke to one medical group in Camden, New Jersey, that had a problem with patients standing them up. They started asking people why they hadn't come. Many said they just didn't have reliable transportation to get there. ""They implemented a ride share, which came at a cost to the office, but their attendance levels went right up and more than compensated for the cost of the rides,"" Donovan said. When you make a doctor's appointment, ask about the office's policy around late cancellations and missed appointments, Donovan said. If you're told you'll be charged for missing an appointment, ask if you can reschedule it instead. You can also try asking the office if they can waive the charge if you find it unfair or if you can't afford it, she said. They should work with you. ""Ultimately, these fees are discretionary and I would be reluctant to work with any office that inflexibly charged them,"" Donovan said. On a practical note, debt owed to a doctor's or dentist's office is considered medical debt, a spokesperson for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told CNBC. Such debts that are less than $500 are not reported to the credit bureaus, they added. As a result, it seems unlikely that a no-show fee would harm your credit. When my sister Janna got her no-show invoice, she simply called the number on the bill and explained that she'd tried without success to cancel her appointment. The customer service agent agreed to waive the fee immediately. ""I feel like they have a system where they send out the bill for a no-show and then if people make the effort of calling it to question it, they'll get rid of it,"" Janna said.

<p>In March, the SEC <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-admin-finalizes-rule-forcing-companies-to-disclose-climate-related-risks-5602155"">finalized</a> a controversial rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose any climate-related risks to their business. The SEC’s Final Rules also required some midsize and large firms to reveal how much CO2 is emitted from their operations. This led to several Republican states, companies, and business groups filing lawsuits against the regulations, asking for the SEC rule to be stayed. Two energy companies—Liberty Energy Inc. and Nomad Proppant Services LLC—sought an administrative stay on the rule, which was granted by the Fifth Circuit court on March 15.</p>

<p>According to SEC rules, businesses must report on the potential impact climate risks may have on their financial condition as well as the strategies undertaken to mitigate such risks. Businesses have to disclose their climate targets and the losses suffered due to severe weather events.</p>

<p><strong>Other legal challenges against the rule were filed at the Second, Sixth, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuit courts. All the lawsuits, including the Fifth Circuit one, were consolidated into a single case, with the Eight Circuit set to hear the <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">challenge</a>.</strong></p>

<p>On March 26, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Texas Association of Business, and the Longview Chamber of Commerce filed a motion in the Eighth Circuit, seeking a stay of the SEC rules pending judicial review.</p>

<h2>Challenging SEC</h2>

<p>Lawsuits from Republican states <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/nine-more-states-sue-sec-over-controversial-climate-disclosure-rule-5607260"">claim</a> that the SEC breached their rule-making authority by asking public firms to disclose climate risks while such regulations have not received approval from Congress.</p>

<p><strong>SEC’s rules create costly, unnecessary “red tape” for businesses.</strong> They accused the climate rules of being part of the Biden administration’s push to make sure investment decisions in the country are driven by climate considerations rather than financial returns.</p>

<p>On April 4, SEC Secretary Vanessa Countryman issued an <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/33-11280.pdf"">order</a> staying the agency’s climate rule requirements while litigation proceeded in the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>Ms. Countryman argued that given the procedural complexities involved in litigating the multiple cases filed against the climate rules, the SEC’s stay “will facilitate the orderly judicial resolution of those challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>In addition, “a stay avoids potential regulatory uncertainty if registrants were to become subject to the Final Rules’ requirements during the pendency of the challenges to their validity.”</strong></p>

<p>Though the SEC is issuing a stay on the climate rule, the agency continues to hold the view that the regulations are “consistent with applicable law” and within the authority of the commission, the order stated.</p>

<p>“Thus, the Commission will continue vigorously defending the Final Rules’ validity in court and looks forward to expeditious resolution of the litigation.”</p>

<h2>‘Outrageous’ Climate Mandate</h2>

<p>Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, one of the Republican AGs that led 25 states to file lawsuits against the climate rules, called the SEC’s April 4 stay a “victory” that “shuts down the most outrageous climate mandate for businesses since Biden took office.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“The SEC’s job is to protect people from fraud. It has no business slapping companies with extremist climate mandates. We are making it clear that Biden has to follow the law like everyone else,”</strong></em> she said.</p>

<p><em><strong>“By halting this mandate, we are protecting businesses from costly red tape, securing our supply chain, and defending family farms. Next, we are going to make this win permanent!”</strong></em></p>

<p>In addition to Iowa, other states in the lawsuit are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>The SEC rule “will also require businesses to disclose climate-related risks, including higher insurance rates from weather disasters, and release a plan to adapt to climate-agenda recommendations.<strong> The plan is estimated to cost businesses billions of dollars every year</strong>.”</p>

<h2>SEC Votes</h2>

<p>When the SEC finalized its climate rules in March, agency commissioners had voted 3–2 to pass the measure. The votes were done along party lines, with all Democrats voting in favor of the rule and Republican commissioners voting against it.</p>

<p>Republican commissioner Hester Peirce had pointed out that the climate rules would be expensive and burdensome for businesses while creating a large amount of inconsistent information overwhelming investors.</p>

<p><strong>“However well-intentioned, these particularized interests don’t justify forcing investors who don’t share them to foot the bill,”</strong> he said. <strong>The SEC estimates the climate rule to impact around 2,800 American firms.</strong></p>

<p>The rules adopted in March were a watered-down version of an earlier draft that contained more stringent measures, including requiring companies to report certain indirect emissions. These stringent measures triggered intense opposition from the business community.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/sec-climate-proposal-violates-first-amendment-to-constitution-law-professor-4515589"">The Epoch Times</a> in June 2022, Sean Griffith, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, suggested that SEC rules enforce viewpoint discrimination since the regulations are essentially forcing companies to endorse certain assumptions about how the earth’s climate is being affected by human actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>“The reason why the climate rules are so problematic is that either they’re politically driven—which is very plausible—or they are driven by this desire to appease the institutional asset manager community, which has its own profit interest because they generate revenue from the assets under management of those ESG portfolios.

<p>Konrad explained, ""Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead.

<p>Here's more from Konrad on X and his epic rant against the ""West Point Mafia"": </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>China could have the Baltimore ship channel fully cleared in weeks but yesterday @POTUS said yesterday for the Army Corps of Engineers it will take months.</em></p>

<p><em>I blame the West Point Mafia and their budget demon. Please let me explain…</em></p>

<p><em>Truth is bridges are an Army Corps of Engineers responsibility but they are so unprepared they gave the job to Navy Salvage to lead. Navy salvage is so broken they had to outsource it to the US subsidiary/partner of a European firm which is chartering equipment from private companies at great expense. Equipment that's weak &amp; small compared to what the European parent has overseas.</em></p>

<p><em>And it's the Army's own fault. The West Point Mafia has systematically destroyed our nation's maritime strength. </em></p>

<p><em>When I was 10 Vinzzini taught me the first lesson of war ""You've fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never get involved in a land war in Asia"" </em></p>

<p><em>Yet in my adult life the United States fought not one but two wars in Asia. </em></p>

<p><em>How did we pay for those? By gutting our maritime capabilities. </em></p>

<p><em>With Chinese military capability growing exponentially, how do you win a war in Asia? The same way we did in WW2: with ships &amp; marines with the Army and Air Force serving a support role </em></p>

<p><em>Except there is a problem, the current and last Secretaries of Defense are West Pointers. The SECDEF before that was a marine but he was forced out after a disagreement with the Secretary of State who was a West Pointer </em></p>

<p><em>Two decades of Land Wars in asia have decimated our Maritime capabilities as trillions was rerouted into Army coffers by the West Point mafia demon in DC </em></p>

<p><em>And now that the land wars are over is the Army Corps of Engineers helping rebuild shipyards and bridges? Is the Army rebuilding its once mighty fleet of dredges? Is it working jointly with the SeaBees and Merchant Marine? Is it rebuilding watercraft? </em></p>

<p><em>No today's West Point mafia leader Jack Reed controls the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee &amp; has blocked the Future of the Navy Commission That Congress created to develop a Naval rebuilding strategy </em></p>

<p><em>Now under General Lloyd Austin &amp; Reed EVERY SINGLE navy shipbuilding project is delayed. </em></p>

<p><em>The West Point Mafia has gutted every Maritime service: </em></p>

<p><em>Navy National Guard (Naval Militia): now only a boat service in a small handful of states </em></p>

<p><em>United States Navy Armed Guard: gone </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy Reserve: zero ships in inventory </em></p>

<p><em>USCG Icebreaker fleet: down to one ship </em></p>

<p><em>US Navy salvage fleet: mostly gone </em></p>

<p><em>Seabees: cut to 7,000 active personnel </em></p>

<p><em>Merchant Marine: now less than 80 ships in international service </em></p>

<p><em>MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet: small &amp; on average age a half century old </em></p>

<p><em>US Maritime Service: just a handful of officers at the US Merchant Marine academy </em></p>

<p><em>Marine Hospital Service; gone except the uniforms </em></p>

<p><em>NOAA Officer Corps: down to 330 officers </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers dredge fleet: includes ancient hulls like the 57-year-old dredge McFarland </em></p>

<p><em>Army Corps of Engineers salvage: the last SECDEF, @EsperDoD sold all Army salvage vessels in Baltimore</em></p>

<p><em>Army Watercraft: gutted by at action by Esper </em></p>

<p><em>USCG: forced to cut 10 cutters this year alone </em></p>

<p><em>I could go on but I have something more important to say: </em></p>

<p><em>🚨 NOW THEY ARE COMING FOR THE CARRIERS AND SUBMARINES🚨</em></p>

<p><em>(I will post the details of the carrier and sub delays in post 2 of the thread) </em></p>

<p><em>If Jack Reed &amp; the West Point Mafia wins the next war in Asia will be lost. </em></p>

<p><em>Problem is there is nobody to stop them because the think tanks, defense contractors and DoD civil servants know who wields the power and nobody in Navy or Coast Guard uniform has the moral courage to ruin their career by calling out Jack Reed &amp; General Austin in the media or during a senate hearing. </em></p>

<p><em>PS why am I using quotes from the Princess Bride &amp; making light of the problem by creating the West Point Mafia Demon meme? Because it doesn't require a PhD to see what is happening. </em></p>

<p><em>The gutting of every critical maritime capability to pour money into Land Wars is something any 10 year can see is idiotic.</em></p>

"<p>A divide among Democrats over whether to halt defense aid to Israel is growing more fierce, causing a crisis and headache for Biden strategists ahead of the presidential election, which has only intensified in the wake of last week's Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza, which left seven international workers dead, including an American.</p>

<p>This <strong>intensifying fragmentation of Biden's base</strong> has been on display this weekend also given former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - still very influential among Dems - has publicly come out against Biden's policy to continue arming Israel. The issue is entering the heart of the Democratic establishment, threatening unity.</p>

<p>Axios <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel"">reports</a> that she ""<strong>signed onto a call by progressive members of Congress for the U.S. to stop transferring weapons to Israel</strong> over a strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza.""</p>

Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), included the signatures of some 40 Democrats.</p>

<p>""In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, <strong>we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers</strong>,"" the lawmakers stated in the letter addressed to President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>

<p>""If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, <strong>we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable</strong>,"" the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p>However, a follow-up statement from a Pelosi representative to <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/pelosi-call-halt-us-weapons-transfers-israel""><em>Axios</em></a> has this to say: ""Speaker Pelosi knows President Biden's support for Israel and empathy with the innocent civilians in Gaza, and she respects his judgment in how to proceed.""</p>

<p>This trend of the Gaza war becoming a bright red dividing line among Democrats is also on display with recent stories like the following from <em>Epoch Times</em>-- <a href=""https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/pro-israel-democrat-group-endorses-squad-primary-opponents-5621382""><em>Pro-Israel Democrat Group Endorses ‘Squad’ Primary Opponents</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>A Democrat pro-Israel group has endorsed candidates challenging incumbents who are members of the far-left congressional group “The Squad.”</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) announced on April 3 its backing of Westchester County Executive George Latimer and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.</em></p>

<p><em>DMFI did not state its reasons for backing the two other than through announcing <a href=""https://x.com/DemMaj4Israel/status/1775561625413579064?s=20"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a slate</a> of endorsements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So now the 'fight' is on and it's becoming a real issue with campaign money lining up on either side</strong>. Still, those voters who put the Squad members in office in the first place are more than likely to come down on the <em>anti-Israel </em>side. </p>

<p>Another indicator that the internal Democrat divide is accelerating is that the controversy has completely altered a long-standing White House tradition. <strong>Muslim leaders are boycotting an annual White House Ramadan gathering</strong> which marks the end of the Muslim <a href=""https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/white-house-scales-back-iftar-gaza-horrors-declined-invites"">season of fasting</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Biden administration is hosting a scaled-down Ramadan gathering for Muslim and Arab Americans after <strong>several community leaders declined the invite over the unrelenting and steadfast nature of US support for Israel’s war</strong> on Gaza.</em></p>

<p><em>The event scheduled for Tuesday will be in <strong>stark contrast to previous Muslim celebrations</strong> and gatherings under the Biden administration, which have seen packed ballrooms of Muslims from all over the country joining the White House festivities. </em></p>

<p><em>This year, the iftar will be <strong>confined to staffers only</strong>, and a separate gathering will take place for Muslim community members.</em></p>

<p><strong>When I was in academics, my research program was on the application of psychology to economics, especially the fundamental psychological law of sensitivity to adaptation level.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, I was featured in a front-page article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on “animal spirits” or confidence levels.</p>

<p><strong>I discovered that when the unemployment level rises above a 4-year exponential moving average of the unemployment rate (in which more recent observations are weighted more heavily), confidence collapses, the unemployment rate skyrockets upward, and economic activity contracts sharply. </strong></p>

<p>This event marks the end of the business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>President Trump took to social media on Friday to denounce the conviction.</strong></p>

<p>“Rebecca Lavrez, also known as the ‘J6 Praying Grandma,’ has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden’s DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th!” he wrote in a <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112219276184310776"">post on Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>President Trump said that <strong>Ms. Lavrez, a 71-year-old grandmother and small business owner from Colorado, has now become “one of Joe Biden’s J6 HOSTAGES!!!”</strong></p>

<p>President Trump has made the alleged mistreatment of Jan. 6 defendants a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, vowing to use executive power to issue pardons and free Jan. 6 “hostages” soon after taking office, if elected.</p>

<p>“Crooked Joe Biden spends more time prosecuting Patriots like Rebecca, AND ME, than Violent Criminals, Thugs, Murderers, and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS who are destroying our Country. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST,” President Trump added in his post.</p>

<p>President Biden has been sharply critical of President Trump’s statements about the Jan. 6 defendants, while <strong>Attorney General Merrick Garland has promised to press ahead with more Jan. 6 prosecutions</strong>—and to cast the Justice Department’s dragnet even more widely to include people who weren’t even present at the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>“As I said before, the Justice Department will hold all January 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under the law—whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Mr. Garland said in a speech on Jan. 5.</p>

<p>More than 1,350 people have been charged with various crimes in relation to the Jan. 6 Capitol breach, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies such as seditious conspiracy and assaulting police officers.</p>

<p>Of these, roughly 800 have been sentenced, with nearly two-thirds receiving some time in prison.</p>

<h2>‘I Went There To Pray’</h2>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz, who calls herself the “J6 Praying Great-Grandma” in her X <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma"">account bio</a>, was convicted by a federal jury on April 4 on four criminal counts.</p>

<p>After nearly 26 hours of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building.</p>

<p><strong>In an April 5 appearance on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” program, Ms.<em> </em>Lavrenz said she only spent 10 minutes inside the Capitol and that she traveled to Washington on Jan. 6 to pray for America’s future.</strong></p>

<p>“<strong>I went there to pray</strong>,” Ms. Lavrenz told Mr. Bannon. She explained that she was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 “because I love God, my country, and my family, and I knew that something wasn’t right in that 2020 election.”</p>

<p>Ms. Lavrenz was captured on video surveillance entering the Capitol building through the East Rotunda doors, walking around the building, and speaking briefly with a police officer before exiting the building, according to charging documents.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) alleged in the complaint against her that Ms. Lavrenz volunteered photos of herself at the Capitol on the day of the breach to FBI agents. The complaint says the Falcon, Colorado, resident “admitted traveling to Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 to attend the ‘Stop the Steal’ rally on the mall and ‘following the crowd to the U.S. Capitol building.’”</p>

<p>In its statement of facts against Ms. Lavrenz, the DOJ said the grandmother of seven entered the building despite seeing physical barriers “indicating the U.S. Capitol building grounds were a restricted area.”</p>

<p>The filing also states that she “observed people getting into physical confrontations with police” and that she “saw a woman get injured in the exchange.” Video evidence confirmed Ms. Lavrenz’s statement that she was inside the building for only 10 minutes, per the court filings.</p>

<p>Several days before the start of her trial, Ms. Lavrenz posted a <a href=""https://twitter.com/j6prayingrandma/status/1770512873745260953"">video</a> of herself online as she entered the Capitol grounds for the first time since Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

<p>“<strong>My own country is treating me like a criminal just because I believe that my—they stole my rightful president, and just standing up for my country makes me a criminal,</strong>” she said in the video. “It’s not right. It feels so weird to be here.”</p>

<p>A retired register nurse, Ms. Lavrenz also owns and operates a bed and breakfast near the Rocky Mountains in Falcon, Colorado.</p>

<p>She has set up a GiveSendGo <a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">crowdfunding </a><a href=""https://www.givesendgo.com/rebeccalavrenz"">page</a> to help pay for her legal bills and as of Saturday had received over $82,000 in donations.</p>

"<p>Abandoning petrol-burning vehicles and adopting low-­carbon technologies to power tomorrow's economy are trends accelerating across the nation. To do this, access to rare earth metals, key ingredients in many of these 'green' technologies, must be sourced domestically - not from China, an emerging national security threat to the US. As the world fractures into a multipolar state, there is a big push domestically to revive America's metals and mining industry and reduce reliance on Asia. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Carlos De Alba recently conveyed his optimistic outlook for the US metals and mining sector to clients. He highlighted that investment levels in the industry have reached their lowest level in decades. He believes the sector is poised for massive investments and outlines the companies that will benefit. </p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""9b8c052b-1990-4e71-80c3-2dcafb648be1"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""231"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2024-04-06_08-11-37.png?itok=vVOAgS0V"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<p>""US reliance on import critical minerals has reached a 30-year high, and investment in the industry is near its lowest point in decades,"" the analyst said, pointing out America's heavy reliance on imported minerals from China:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The US government has identified 50 minerals it deems critical to the US economy and to national security; for 43 of those critical minerals, more than 50% of domestic consumption depends on imports. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Since 1990, the US has seen a significant increase in both the variety of imported minerals and the level of dependence on these imports. In 1990, the US was fully reliant on imports for the supply of 9 minerals, and imports exceeded 50% of consumption for 27 minerals (including all minerals, not only critical ones).</em></p>

<p><em> These figures have risen to 15 and 51, respectively, as of 2022. China currently dominates the global mineral processing/refining industry, and the US is heavily reliant on China (&gt;50% of net import reliance) for imports of 26 minerals."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>China's global dominance in rare earth metals is a national security threat. Were Western leaders asleep at the wheel over the last three-plus decades to allow this to happen? </p>

<p>The analyst detailed how China dominates the global supply of rare earth minerals and cautioned against rising vulnerabilities in US mineral supply chains, especially given the ongoing tensions in Sino-US relations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""China is in a powerful position to influence the global mineral markets and has already started to flex its strength through mineral export restrictions. For US policymakers, the US's mineral dependence on imports highlights the growing vulnerability of the US mineral supply chain and the urgent need to strengthen domestic supply chains. In addition, the US faces a multi-decade decline in investment in the domestic mining and exploration industry, which has fallen from ~2.0% of GDP in 1960 (and a peak of ~3.1% in 1981) to just ~0.5% today.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being asleep at the wheel for decades, the bloated US government, thank former President Trump - has awakened from its slumber and realized that it must play a serious ""catch-up"" game with policy reform and incentives for private industry to rebuild America's domestic mining and separation sector. </p>

<p>""US permitting reform and other government incentives will likely act as a tailwind for the domestic mining industry through encouraging the development and helping mitigate the associated risks of building new mine supply,"" the analyst said.</p>

<p>He said the big winner of ""permitting reform"" that is ""geared toward promoting the development of mining projects"" will be the ""Junior Mining and Exploration industry."" </p>

<p>One company that stands to benefit is MP Materials, the largest US-based miner of rare earths. The analyst said this company is a ""play on accelerating adoption of electric vehicles and electrification trends in wind turbines."" </p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>""The company's mission is to restore the full US rare earth supply chain. MP has executed on its plan of restarting the Mountain Pass mine in California and it is currently ramping a refining facility to produce rare earth oxides. The company will get into the production of NdFeB alloy flake and permanent mag-nets (critical components for electric vehicles and wind turbines) with a plant that is under construction in Texas."" </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shares of MP Materials have roundtripped Covid lows. </p>

<p>He said Cleveland-Cliffs Inc and United States Steel Corporation are ""key beneficiaries to building ex-China supply chains given CLF is currently the only producer of electrical steel in the US and X is ramping up a greenfield electrical steel facility this year."" </p>

<p>He added: ""All steel names under our coverage (NUE, STLD, CLF and X) will broadly benefit from re-shoring trends given manufacturing facilities, and the equipment to outfit them is often steel intensive."" </p>

<p>And the analyst listed a few junior miners with assets in the US that should interest investors:</p>

<ul><li>

<p>One in five Americans regularly reach for vitamin D supplements, yet <strong>most are unaware that they’re taking not just a vitamin -  but a hormone</strong>.</p>

<p>While renowned for bolstering bone strength and immune health, vitamin D’s story is not straightforward. A blend of myth and established science invites a closer look into its true nature and impact.</p>

<p><a data-image-external-href="""" data-image-href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" data-link-option=""0"" href=""/s3/files/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31""><picture><img data-entity-type=""file"" data-entity-uuid=""982962b8-f01f-4029-9baa-c43aba0a0a5a"" data-responsive-image-style=""inline_images"" height=""333"" width=""500"" class=""inline-images image-style-inline-images"" src=""https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20-%202024-04-06T111121.451.jpg?itok=NoqELg31"" alt="""" typeof=""foaf:Image"" /></picture></a></p>

<h2>Vitamin D: Understanding Its Dual Role</h2>

<p>Vitamin D stands apart in the world of nutrients. It’s a sun-sourced substance acting as both a nutrient and a hormone. This dual role is significant, as hormones, which orchestrate many bodily functions, aren’t typically taken as supplements like vitamins.</p>

<p>Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Holick, a leading vitamin D expert, tells The Epoch Times,<em><strong> “The body more effectively utilizes vitamin D when it’s naturally synthesized from sunlight, compared to standard supplement doses.” </strong></em></p>

<p>This difference is key to understanding vitamin D’s health role and the complexities of supplementing a hormone.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike most nutrients, the hormonal nature of vitamin D means it has a broader systemic impact, influencing not just bone health but also immune function, cell growth, and inflammation control. </strong>This understanding is crucial in guiding medical approaches to its use, including the potential risks and benefits of supplementation.</p>

<h2>Beyond Bone Health</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is more than just a bone health and immune system booster. Its multifaceted role in the body impacts everything from mood regulation to cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>At its core, vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption in the gut, and essential for bone strength and health. “Without enough Vitamin D, the body can only absorb 10–15 percent of calcium,” <a href=""https://bhinstitute.com/"">Dr. Alex Foxman</a>, a leading internist and preventive care specialist, told The Epoch Times. Insufficient calcium can result in weaker bones and heightened fracture risks.</p>

<p>Moreover, vitamin D is pivotal for immune health. Dr. Holick observes,<em><strong> “Vitamin D receptors are in almost every cell, including immune cells.” </strong></em>Proper levels are vital for a balanced immune response and preventing autoimmune disorders.</p>

<p><a href=""https://brio-medical.com/team/dr-nathan-goodyear-md/"">Dr. Nathan Goodyear</a>, an integrative cancer physician and director of Brio Medical, an integrative cancer treatment center in Scottsdale, Arizona, stresses vitamin D’s essential role in immune functionality and its influence on chronic diseases, like cancer. He explains, “The immune system does not work well if vitamin D is not optimal,” <strong>emphasizing its role in cancer, where immune strength is crucial.</strong></p>

<p>Recent research, including melanoma <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37089083/"">studies</a>, indicates that vitamin D supplementation can enhance treatment responses and prolong survival in cancer patients, even with currently insufficient daily dosage recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D also plays a significant role in heart health.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851242/#:~:text=In%20more%20than%203000%20subjects,%3E30%20ng%2FmL)."">Studies</a> have linked low vitamin D levels to an elevated risk of heart disease. Those deficient in vitamin D are more likely to experience hypertension, heart failure, and strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Mental health is another arena where vitamin D plays a significant role. </strong></p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, a licensed psychotherapist, told The Epoch Times, “There’s a clear link between low levels of vitamin D and higher incidences of depression and mood disorders.”</p>

<p><strong>It also affects seasonal affective disorder, a depression variant tied to seasonal changes.</strong> “I have seen my patients have a reduction of symptoms once they started to become consistent with their vitamin D intake,” she reports.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D’s Journey From Sunlight to Cellular Powerhouse</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital for health, existing in different forms, each taking a unique path within our body. Grasping these forms is key to understanding how vitamin D functions in our system.</p>

<p><strong>Once vitamin D enters our body through sun, diet, or supplements, it transforms to become active. </strong></p>

<p>First, it changes into calcidiol in the liver, then into calcitriol, its active form, in the kidneys. Dr. Holick clarifies, “Calcitriol is the form that our body can use to perform various functions.”</p>

<p><strong>Interestingly, each form of vitamin D undergoes a similar conversion process in the body. The source of vitamin D might differ, but the pathway it takes in our bodies converges.</strong></p>

<p>The conversion efficiency of vitamin D can differ. The skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 diminishes with age and is influenced by skin pigmentation, geographical location, and lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Controversies in Vitamin D Testing</h2>

<p>The routine way to measure vitamin D levels in the body is through a blood test called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This measurement reflects vitamin D levels from sunlight, food, and supplements. The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665033/#:~:text=Serum%2025(OH)D%20is,associated%20with%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">less recommended</a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D test fails to gauge vitamin D reserves, rendering it ineffective for patient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D blood testing has surged, ranking as Medicare’s <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-09-22-00400.pdf"">eighth most common</a> lab test.</strong> <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/11/2740967/32656/en/Vitamin-D-Testing-Market-Size-Share-to-Hit-USD-1-06-billion-by-2031-Expanding-at-a-CAGR-of-5-8-Exclusive-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research.html"">Market reports</a> pegged the 2023 testing market at $677.5 million, with projections reaching $1.06 billion by 2031.</p>

<p>Once led by giants like Abbott, Siemens, and Quest Diagnostics, the vitamin D testing market is now seeing a surge in home testing kits from smaller companies. Dr. Holick recalls, “Years ago, I told Quest that this would be their number one seller.”</p>

<p><em><strong>“More than 10 million vitamin D blood tests are done annually in the United States, even though these tests are not recommended by major medical organizations,”</strong></em> Dr. Morton Tavel, a cardiologist and specialist in internal medicine and cardiovascular disease, told The Epoch Times. He references a <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32675268/"">2020 Virginia health system study</a>, where 10 percent of patients underwent vitamin D tests, often without medical indication.</p>

<p>Beyond adults, vitamin D testing in children skyrocketed 30-fold in 15 years, as per a <a href=""https://adc.bmj.com/content/108/9/742"">BMJ study</a>, though it didn’t significantly alter low vitamin D diagnosis rates.</p>

<p><strong>This increase in vitamin D testing contrasts with medical associations’ <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070270"">guidelines</a>, which generally discourage routine testing in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals.</strong></p>

<p>For instance, the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">Endocrine Society</a> recommends screening only high-risk groups. The <a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778487"">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> sees insufficient evidence for universal screening. <a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/67.html"">Choosing Wisely</a> also advises against testing in low-risk groups, including the general population.</p>

<p>Dr. Joel Finkelstein from Massachusetts General Hospital’s Bone Density Center, as reported in a Harvard Health <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893"">blog</a>, voices skepticism about the rampant vitamin D deficiency screening, deeming many checks on healthy individuals unnecessary.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Vitamin D has been hyped massively,” he states. “We do not need to be checking the vitamin D levels of most healthy individuals.” He challenges the evolutionary need for high vitamin D, noting its limited presence in natural foods and reduced synthesis in darker skin, common in sun-rich areas.</strong></em></p>

<p>However, many functional medicine and naturopathic doctors recommend regular vitamin D testing.</p>

<p><strong>The College of Naturopathic Medicine <a href=""https://www.naturopathy-uk.com/news/news-cnm-blog/blog/2021/06/23/why-is-vitamin-d-important/"">advises</a> those in sun-poor climates to test routinely for better health maintenance.</strong></p>

<p>Aligning with this view, Dr. Goodyear emphasizes the tests’ relevance, particularly regarding inflammation and chronic diseases like cancer. He told The Epoch Times, “Vitamin D will always be low in the place of significant inflammation, both acute and chronic,” advocating for regular monitoring for proper supplementation.</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear draws an analogy to salmon swimming upstream against a current of inflammation, illustrating the challenges in increasing plasma vitamin D levels in such conditions. He likens this process to standard medical practices like monitoring blood pressure, emphasizing the need for a similar approach in natural therapies, <em><strong>“The process is to evaluate, dose, re-evaluate, and then re-dose,” </strong></em>he adds.</p>

<p>Reflecting the views of Linus Pauling, considered to be the “father of vitamin C,” Dr. Goodyear criticizes the medical oversight of pharmacokinetics and dynamics in natural therapies. He explains that physicians learn drug dosage precision but often forget that this also applies to vitamins. He advocates for a tailored approach in vitamin D therapy, moving away from a one-size-fits-all methodology.</p>

<h2>Defining Optimal Vitamin D Levels</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2015/0501/od2.html#:~:text=USPSTF%20ASSESSMENT,early%20intervention%20cannot%20be%20determined."">According to</a> the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, “No consensus exists on the definition of vitamin D deficiency or the optimal level of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin.”</p>

<p><strong>Some experts view 25(OH)D levels under 30 ng/mL as deficient. Common standards suggest 30-60 ng/mL as sufficient.

<p>The <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">NIH</a> clarifies that optimal vitamin D levels are unestablished, as they “vary by stage of life, by race and ethnicity, and with each physiological measure used.”</p>

<p>Contrasting these guidelines, voices like Dr. Goodyear’s claim current vitamin D dose recommendations are too low. He labels the current U.S. recommended daily allowances as “woefully inadequate.”</p>

<p>Dr. Goodyear notes that the conventional focus on preventing rickets overlooks the broader health benefits of higher vitamin D levels. This stance argues for higher optimal ranges, implying current standards don’t fully exploit the vitamin’s health potential.</p>

<h2>Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is vital, however, there’s concern about its overconsumption, particularly via supplements. <strong>Unlike water-soluble vitamins, which our bodies can quickly expel when in excess, vitamin D is fat-soluble and can accumulate in the liver and fat tissues to harmful levels, termed “vitamin D intoxication.”</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Holick cautions that vitamin D intoxication, though extremely rare, is severe. Sun exposure can’t cause Vitamin D toxicity, but excessive supplementation can. “Any excess vitamin D made by the sun is destroyed by the sun. You can never become vitamin D intoxicated from sun exposure, but you can from supplements if you take too much,” he warns.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D toxicity triggers excessive calcium in the blood, leading to nausea, vomiting, and weakness. If untreated, it can escalate to kidney damage, bone pain, and, rarely, death.</strong></p>

<p>Some practitioners, including Pam Schoenfeld, a registered dietitian, assert that excessive vitamin D intake can lead to the depletion of retinol, the active form of vitamin A. Ms. Schoenfeld told The Epoch Times, “The current landscape of vitamin D supplementation often neglects the intricate balance with other crucial fat-soluble vitamins.”</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/vitamin-a-the-scarlet-nutrient/#gsc.tab=0"">an article</a> for the Weston Price Foundation, Ms. Schoenfeld cautions, <em><strong>“More astute practitioners know that supplementing with vitamin D, especially at levels of 5,000 IU per day ... is not advisable unless attention is paid to ensuring vitamin A intake is optimal.”</strong></em> This perspective emphasizes the delicate balance between these essential nutrients, suggesting that maintaining optimal levels of both is crucial for health, particularly during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Critics, like Dr. Holick, challenge this view, arguing that no substantial evidence supports the claim that Vitamin D adversely affects vitamin A levels. “It’s simply not true,” he notes.</p>

<h2>The Vitamin D Supplementation Dilemma</h2>

<p>Modern indoor lifestyles and diets low in vitamin D contribute to widespread deficiencies. Despite well-balanced diets, about <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-020-0558-y#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency,%5B2%5D%20have%20been%20reported."">1 in 4</a> American adults and <a href=""https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/08/24/vitamin-d-why-you-are-probably-not-getting-enough/"">70 percent</a> of children fall short of necessary vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, supplementation is an important consideration. <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"">Current recommendations</a> call for 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70, and 800 IU for people over 70.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Holick endorses supplements as a straightforward solution, especially for the sun-deprived, <a href=""http://drholick.com/#:~:text=I%20recommend%20to%20all%20of,sensible%20sun%20exposure%20and%20supplements."">suggesting a total daily intake</a> of 2000–3000 IU from diet, sun, and supplements.</strong></p>

<p>However, not all practitioners agree that supplementation is necessary for everyone. “Although many studies had linked low levels of vitamin D to an assortment of medical conditions, when scientists tried administering it as a means to prevent or treat those problems, this ‘wonder’ supplement failed miserably,” Dr. Tavel told The Epoch Times.</p>

<p><strong>Sunshine, a prime vitamin D source, can fulfill needs with minimal exposure. Dr. Tavel notes, “Your vitamin D storage generally lasts for about 10 to 12 weeks,” questioning the need for constant supplementation.</strong></p>

<p>The vitamin D deficiency debate is complex. Dr. Tavel points out that “the widespread notion that much of America is walking around deficient in vitamin D came from a likely misinterpretation of the normal levels for vitamin D set by the Institute of Medicine more than a decade ago.” This has led to overestimation of deficiency rates and potentially unnecessary supplementation.</p>

<p>Yet, he explains, there are specific scenarios where supplementation is beneficial. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises 400 IU of vitamin D daily for breastfed infants. Those with medical conditions or limited sun exposure might also benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Tavel warns that excessive supplementation, linked to <a href=""https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.17290#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20supplementation%20doses%20%E2%89%A5,first%20time%20falls%20with%20fractures."">increased fall risk</a> and other hazards, underscores the need for balance in vitamin D intake.</strong></p>

<p>Supporting Dr. Tavel, New England Journal of Medicine <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106"">research</a> found no fracture risk reduction in healthy adults supplementing with 2000 IU of vitamin D compared to non-supplementers.</p>

<p>Vitamin D’s necessity varies. Dr. Tavel reminds us, “For much of human history, people got their vitamin D mostly from the sun,” highlighting our body’s innate ability to regulate this nutrient.</p>

<p>Determining vitamin D supplementation requires personal assessment, medical consultation, and an eye on guidelines. Generally, a mix of diet, sun, and occasional supplements suffices for most, claims Dr. Tavel.</p>

<h2>Expanding Vitamin D Supplement Industry</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-vitamin-d-ingredients-market-143000228.html"">vitamin D supplement market</a> is rapidly growing, valued at $1,560 million in 2023 and expected to reach $2,780 million by 2033, growing at 5.9 percent annually. Drivers include an aging population, heightened health awareness, and a surge in demand for vitamin-enriched products.</p>

<p><strong>In response to consumer demand, the industry is innovating with new delivery methods and formulations, like gummies, sprays, patches, creams, and potent capsules. This variety meets diverse preferences and needs, including ease of use and better absorption.</strong></p>

<p>The industry’s growth is also propelled by robust marketing and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2023/05/04/ad-the-day-minute-maid-s-hollowed-out-billboard-lets-the-vitamin-d-pour-through"">advertising</a>. Pharma and wellness firms heavily promote vitamin D supplements as key to health, shaping consumer views and fueling market expansion.</p>

<p>While this market growth mirrors a shift in health consciousness, it prompts concerns about self-prescribed supplementation and underscores the importance of a balanced approach to vitamin D consumption.</p>

<h2>Best Sources of Vitamin D</h2>

<p>Sun exposure is key in vitamin D production. UVB (ultraviolet B) rays convert skin cholesterol into vitamin D3, later transformed into calcitriol, its usable form. Interestingly, skin-produced vitamin D remains in the bloodstream for about <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/96/7/1911/2833671?login=false"">twice as long</a> as when ingested by food or vitamins.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight’s vitamin D productivity varies by time, season, and location. The best synthesis is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in warmer months. However, above <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d#:~:text=Except%20during%20the%20summer%20months,risk%20for%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency."">37 degrees latitude</a>, there’s negligible vitamin D production from November to March.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.832659/full"">2022 study</a> concluded, “Sun exposure can significantly make up for deficiencies in subjects who consume insufficient dietary Vit D. Compared with the extra cost and time for building habits of Vit D supplementation, moderate sun exposure appears to be a simple and costless means for the public to start in daily practice.”</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://dminder.ontometrics.com/"">dminder app</a> helps users identify optimal sun exposure times for vitamin D, offering real-time data based on location, time, and weather.</p>

<p><strong>Dietary sources, though fewer, contribute to vitamin D intake. </strong>Fatty fish and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3897585/"">UV-exposed mushrooms</a> are key sources. Incorporating these foods can help maintain vitamin D, especially in less sunny periods.</p>

<p>Supplementation, particularly beneficial for those in higher latitudes, is another method. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30987813/"">A study</a> showed that while both sun and oral D3 supplements raise vitamin D levels, supplements were more effective due to compliance. Simply put, more people took supplements than spent time in the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D supplements are available as D2 (from plants) and D3 (from animals). D3, mirroring the body’s sun-induced production, is often recommended for effectively raising and maintaining vitamin D levels.</strong></p>

<p>However, Dr. Holick asserts that “physiologic doses of D2 and D3 raise vitamin D levels in the blood the same,” effectively debunking myths about their differing impacts on health. Additionally, he confirms that the kidneys equally metabolize both forms.</p>

<p>Dr. Holick also touches on the regulatory history of these supplements in the United States, explaining that vitamin D2 remains the only pharmaceutical form available due to historical U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval processes. “No one ever got approval for D3,” he notes, highlighting a regulatory, rather than a health-based, reason for vitamin D2’s dominance in the market.</p>

<p>Though sunlight is the prime vitamin D source, its availability is inconsistent. Diet and supplements thus serve as vital alternatives to ensure sufficient vitamin D for optimal health.</p>

<h2>Key Considerations for Vitamin D Supplementation</h2>

<p>Understanding how to optimize vitamin D supplementation and reduce risks is crucial:</p>

<h3><strong>Fat-Soluble Nature</strong></h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief and many recommendations, Dr. Michael Holick argues that vitamin D absorption doesn’t depend on dietary fat. He cites studies showing better absorption from skim milk, low in fat, than from full-fat milk. Hence, vitamin D can be taken with or without dietary fat.</p>

<h3>Conjunction With Other Nutrients</h3>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138634/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20notion,for%20bone%20and%20cardiovascular%20health."">Studies suggest</a> taking vitamins D and K together may enhance bone health and reduce arterial calcification risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Magnesium aids vitamin D metabolism, and high vitamin D doses can deplete magnesium levels. Adequate magnesium is <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/"">vital for effective vitamin D use</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamins A and D, both fat-soluble, work together, but consensus on taking them together has not been clearly established.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timing of Dosage:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954071/"">Some suggest</a> aligning vitamin D intake with circadian rhythms, proposing daytime consumption to avoid sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Holick indicates no evidence supporting the idea that vitamin D disrupts sleep, making it safe to take at any time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Choice of Vitamin D Type:</strong> While D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plants and fortified foods and D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal products and sunlight exposure, Dr. Holick states both forms raise and maintain vitamin D levels equally.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Consult Health Care Professionals:</strong> Before starting supplements, consulting a health care provider is essential to determine proper dosing and assess potential interactions with other medications or health conditions.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>While supplements may be useful, integrating them with natural vitamin D sources and a balanced lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being.</p>
",,2024-04-07,,The Reality Of Vitamin D Supplementation
"The idea of raising the Social Security ""No one should have to work longer than they want to,"" Fink recently ""But I do think it's a bit crazy that our anchor idea for the right retirement age — 65 years old — originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire,"" wrote Fink, who is 71. Republicans have touted raising the retirement age. Former presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she would raise the Social Security retirement age for The reason for the suggestion largely comes down to demographics. In the 1950s, many people who worked and paid into Social Security never lived long enough to retire and start receiving benefits, Fink noted. Today, the chances are higher that certain retirees over 65 may still be collecting Social Security checks until age 90, he wrote. Meanwhile, the number of baby boomers who reach age 65 is surging to historic levels. More than 11,200 Americans are expected to turn 65 every day — for a total of More from Personal Finance: That's as Social Security is facing a looming shortfall. The trust fund used to pay retirement and survivors benefits is projected to ""Age 65 is the anchor that is a cultural age which we have hung our retirement hat to for decades,"" said Jason Fichtner, chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center and executive director of the Alliance for Lifetime Income's Retirement Income Institute. ""It is no longer, I think, relevant,"" he said. Today, a new Social Security full retirement age of 67 is still getting phased in, prompted by changes enacted by Congress in 1983. Full retirement age is the point at which retirees stand to receive 100% of the benefits they've earned. For many years, Social Security's full retirement age Social Security benefits are available starting from age 62, "" Retirees who wait to claim until age 70 stand to get the biggest benefit — with an increase of up to 8% for each year they wait past full retirement age. Yet fewer than 10% of claimants wait until that age, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research and author of the book ""Work, Retire, Repeat: The Uncertainty of Retirement in the New Economy."" As lawmakers face a deadline to make changes and address the program shortfall, they generally may choose from a limited menu of options — hiking taxes, cutting benefits or a combination of both. Raising the retirement age, which is often presented as another option, is really a benefit cut, said Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ""When you change the retirement age, it's particularly painful to those who have to keep retiring at 62, people with health issues or people in professions where no jobs are available,"" Munnell said. Congress may eventually raise the full retirement age to 69, predicts Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, even though Democrats have promised not to make that change. ""When you look at countries around the world that have had underfunded pension systems, they raise the retirement age,"" Biggs said. ""It's just a very, very common fix."" For each year the Social Security full retirement age is increased, that would cut benefits by a little under 7%, Biggs said. Pushing the age to 69 would repair less than one-fifth of Social Security's shortfall, so other reforms would also be necessary, Biggs said. Moreover, a new higher retirement age would have to be phased in much faster than the 40-year window used for the last increase, he said. Researchers and policy experts who have spent years studying Social Security's shortfall have their own wish lists for the changes they would make. Fichtner, who supports raising the retirement age, said that change would need to be paired with a higher minimum benefit, so as not to punish workers who cannot work longer. ""Some people have the ability to work, some people want to work, but some people can't,"" Fichtner said. ""It's important that we maintain a healthy minimum benefit amount at age 62."" Increases to the retirement age could be set to automatically adjust to changes in longevity, much as the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustments are tied to inflation, he said. Other experts would opt for different changes in place of raising the retirement age. Biggs advocates for moving to Munnell argues the most effective benefit cut would be to reduce the replacement rates for higher-income workers. Ultimately, workers want to retire on their own terms — at the age they want and with enough money to live comfortably. To make that more possible, employers need to engage older workers so they feel comfortable staying in the workforce, said David Blanchett, managing director and head of retirement research at PGIM DC Solutions. ""There's still potentially some implicit bias towards older Americans leaving the workforce,"" Blanchett said. ""If we can have a president over the age of 75 or 80, I think as a society we should be able to find more ways to accommodate older workers.""

"When it comes to One key theme, overspending, tends to crop up, whether it be on For one pair of clients, realizing how much they had spent in the past 18 months on jewelry — $1.4 million — was a shock, said Barry Glassman, a certified financial planner and founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services in Vienna, Virginia. The following year, after meeting with Glassman, they pared those outlays down to about $8,800, which went mostly to jewelry repairs. ""When people see where their money is going, their behavior changes,"" said Glassman, who is a member of The ultra-high-net worth clients' spending is out of reach for most consumers. But the temptation to overspend can affect everyone, no matter their income. ""At the extreme, this is why most lottery winners go bankrupt,"" Glassman said. ""They feel like they've made it, they feel wealthy,"" he said. ""But they don't realize the difference between wealth and income."" Not all discretionary spending is negative, particularly if it is intentional and aligns with your goals, notes Preston Cherry, a CFP, founder and president of ""There shouldn't be social shame in spending to fund your well-being, present or future,"" said Cherry, who is also a CNBC FA Council member. But Glassman, Cherry and other experts on the council say there are certain risks that can damage your bottom line and put your ability to achieve other goals at risk. When it comes to splurges on big-ticket items, Louis Barajas, a CFP, enrolled agent and CEO of ""This is a work on mindset over budget,"" said Barajas, a CNBC FA Council member. One big-ticket purchase, buying a home, can set people back if they take on too much house or too big of a mortgage, notes CNBC FA Council member Cathy Curtis, a CFP and the founder and CEO of One family Curtis worked with missed out on a few houses by bidding too low. To correct that, they took their realtor's advice to bid high on the next house they found. Curtis' spreadsheets and advice on how much they could afford ""went right out the window,"" she said. The family's house payment, combined with property taxes and insurance, put them at risk for a cash crunch. They reached a low point when the husband lost his job, which prompted the wife to spend down her inheritance. Taking such risks on real estate can be a gamble. While homebuyers may grow into their payments with salary increases, that doesn't always work out, Curtis said. The silver lining is that most real estate tends to appreciate over time, and therefore can be a good investment, she said. When shopping for a home, it is better to treat it as a business decision rather than a personal one, Curtis advised. ""Buying a house can be a very emotional experience,"" Curtis said. ""I advise clients to keep their emotions in check and know that there will always be another house that is a better fit."" Another big-ticket purchase, a college education, may also require keeping emotions in check, particularly if a child's dream school will break the bank. ""Your kids can always borrow money for their college degree, but you can't borrow for your retirement,"" said CNBC FA Council member Ted Jenkin, a CFP and the CEO and founder of Jenkin said he tells clients to prioritize their retirement savings first, and to cut college savings if they are behind on that goal. Smaller purchases can have a sneaky way of adding up over time. When Glassman has his clients do an analysis of their spending, many find they are shocked how their dining-out habits add up. The same may apply to other categories, such as gifts or travel, he said. ""From there, 99% of the time, behavior changes,"" Glassman said, prompted by the realization that small adjustments, such as eating in one time per month or per week, can make a big difference. Assessing just how much is reasonable to spend is a lifelong endeavor, and often a tricky one in retirement. Some retirees may spend too much when they first retire, and be tempted to provide other family members with financial support, notes CNBC FA Council member Ivory Johnson, a CFP and the founder of ""I have had to tell clients to put their family on a budget because I understand the impact it'll have on their retirement,"" Johnson said. Not everyone is susceptible to overspending. For those who are instead prone to saving, drawing from their nest egg can feel uncomfortable once they reach retirement. ""It is challenging to shift from the good saving and investing habits that lead to a secure retirement to spending down assets,"" said CNBC FA Council member For investors who can afford to spend more, that can be a missed opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labor, through gifts to family, travel or donations to causes important to them, she said. Working with a financial advisor can help individuals assess whether their spending is too much, too little or just right. You can also do a gut check on your own by gauging your mindfulness with your money, Cherry suggests. ""Intentional spending within a plan that invests in your wellbeing is perfectly OK,"" Cherry said.

"New cars today are loaded with high-tech features for car shoppers, But with those advancements come questions about ""As much advancement as we have when it comes to new features, many of them are data dependent,"" he said, whether it's through a Almost every new vehicle collects different types of details about you — and they will share and sell that data, according to a More from Personal Finance: Most of the reviewed brands, 84%, share personal data with service providers, data brokers and other parties not named, the report found. About 76%, or 19 of the consulted brands, said they sell customer data to third parties. Only two car brands currently allow users to delete their personal data, Mozilla found: Renault and Dacia. ""This is still kind of the 'Wild, Wild West' of data collection and aggregation,"" said Theresa Payton, the founder, president and chief executive officer of Fortalice Solutions, a cybersecurity advisory firm. ""There are several challenges that remain in place for consumers,"" she said, as drivers try to find the best car that fits within their budgets and their own privacy concerns. To be sure, data collected by cars nowadays may not be too different from that shared from the ""cellphones already in our pocket,"" said Tom McParland, a contributing writer for automotive website Jalopnik and operator of vehicle-buying service Automatch Consulting. Said Drury: ""Think about how you use your phone. There's a lot of stuff that people don't realize that they've already given up when it comes to data."" While it remains to be difficult to do your own research, there are three steps car shoppers can take as they assess potential new cars, experts say. Once you narrow your options down to a specific vehicle, the first thing you can do is talk to the dealership and see what insight they can give you on that brand's data collection practices, experts say. You can ask representatives at the dealership about a carmaker's privacy policies and if you have the ability to opt-in or opt-out of data collection, data aggregation and data monetization — or the selling of your data to third-party vendors, said Payton. Additionally, ask if you can be anonymized and not have the data aggregated under your name and your vehicle's unique identifying number, she said. People at the dealership ""might even point you towards talking to the service manager, who often has to deal with any repairs and any follow up and technical components,"" said Drury. ""Your service provider or the service adviser is actually going to have a little more insight versus the salesperson,"" he said. It may also be worthwhile to ask your auto insurance provider about car data collection, said Drury. Auto insurers may be receiving data of this nature as automakers share or sell it. While people at the dealership will have some knowledge on a specific vehicle, the insurance provider might give a better holistic view of it because they're covering many different makes and models, he said. ""I'd ask the insurance company, 'Are you using this and do you have an option to opt in or opt out different devices to monitor,'"" said Drury. These days, many newer vehicles essentially have an onboard computer. If you don't want to be tracked or have vehicle data collected and shared, you might find instructions in your owner's manual on how to wipe out your personalized data and information from the onboard computer, said Payton. ""That can be a great way if you are already in a car and you love the car, but you don't like the data tracking,"" she said. While you may not know if the data was already collected and sent out to third parties, you could do this on a periodic basis, she said. Some separate online tools might also help: An online resource called Privacy4Cars can help users delete personal data stored by automakers, including text messages and geolocations, Payton said. ""They are providing this tool to help users understand the data their cars collect and to give them an option to safeguard their privacy,"" she said. In a recent episode from The New York Times' ""The Daily"" podcast, a woman paid a mechanic $400 to remove the device in her vehicle that provided internet connectivity. She essentially While it may be possible to isolate and remove a car part or chip like this, you can't just rip out a CPU of a car, said McParland. ""Almost everything nowadays is going to have these integrated systems,"" he said. Drury agreed: ""These systems are so integrated with everything that your vehicle's doing. [The] sensors ... that help with [a] vehicle's semi-autonomous features, those are wired to your throttle, to your steering, to your breaks. It can be extremely dangerous for somebody to go around there and start unplugging things."" Drivers can always tap into the older, used car market to find a vehicle without high-tech features, but such cars might have their own risks the older they are, said McParland. Additionally, the car's onboard computer can provide a lot of safety features like car alerts, said Payton: ""If you were to ostensibly turn off the onboard computer, you might miss out.

"The Social Security Administration has The change applies to Approximately Under the new rule, which goes into effect Sept. 30, food will no longer count toward calculations for eligibility for benefits, known as In-Kind Support and Maintenance, or ISM. Currently, support in the form of food, shelter or both may count as unearned income for SSI beneficiaries, and therefore reduce their payments or affect their eligibility for benefits. More from Personal Finance: The monthly maximum federal SSI amounts in 2024 are To qualify for SSI, beneficiaries must generally earn That generally includes either money or other assets that can be turned into cash, such as bank accounts, bonds, property and stocks. The new rule means SSI beneficiaries will no longer have to worry that the groceries or meals they receive from family or friends may reduce their monthly benefits, said Darcy Milburn, director of Social Security and health care policy at The Arc, a nonprofit organization serving people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The Social Security Administration, in turn, will no longer have to use its limited resources to document every time a beneficiary received free food and then cut their monthly benefit by as much as a third, she said. ""It represents a really meaningful step to address one of the most complex, burdensome and inhumane policies impacting people with disabilities that receive SSI,"" Milburn said. The change is the first of several updates the Social Security Administration said it plans to put in place for SSI beneficiaries and applicants. ""Simplifying our policies is a common-sense solution that reduces the burden on the public and agency staff and helps promote equity by removing barriers to accessing payments,"" Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in a statement. The new rule may help provide some relief to SSI beneficiaries as high inflation continues to prompt ""People on SSI are one of the most food insecure groups in the United States,"" said Thomas Foley, executive director at the National Disability Institute. The new rule may also result in fewer overpayments or underpayments of benefits, and therefore increase financial security for beneficiaries, he said. Congress may have the opportunity to enact bigger changes to SSI through a ""Disability affects everybody, so it's a bipartisan issue,"" Foley said. ""Restricting asset limits to the $2,000 level really impacts people's ability to save and build a better financial future,"" he said. In December, bank CEOs including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon ""We have employees who don't want us to increase their salary because if it goes over a certain amount, they can't get that benefit which they're entitled to,"" Dimon said in December.

"Americans hate to However, reframing the concept can yield more positive results, experts said. They ""cringe"" at the word budgeting, said Winnie Sun, co-founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners, based in Irvine, California. ""It's sort of like telling someone they need to diet and eat healthy,"" said Sun, a member of CNBC's About 68% of consumers say a budget would help them reach their personal and family goals, yet 40% say they have never had a budget, according to a Sun estimates more than 60% of her clients ""feel as if they're literally going to suffer"" if Sun mentions budgeting. Conversations around budgeting are generally distilled into two camps: spending on needs (i.e., essential items) and wants (nonessential items). This framework is meant to help weigh one's financial priorities, thereby keeping spending in check, But the exercise can turn budgeting into a feeling of deprivation — and people rebel as a result. The classic financial advice of slashing spending on wants such as entertainment, social connection, dating and education, for example, is at odds with ""the natural process of human motivation,"" Newcomb wrote. ""Yes, the numbers must work, but your life must work, too,"" she wrote. ""Otherwise, you'll internally resist your budget, and we all know how that can play out."" Financial experts recommend reframing the budgeting concept as a positive rather than a negative. For example, households can think of it as ""raising funds"" instead of cutting spending, Sun said. They can also establish financial goals. For example, what do they want to do with their extra funds? That may be paying down debt, saving for the long term or growing a pot of money for shorter-term goals such as a vacation, Sun said. ""We let the goals lead the act of budgeting,"" she said. ""For me, a budget is not about restricting myself,"" Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, a personal finance expert known as the Money Coach, Similarly, Newcomb recommends identifying new strategies that can meet one's needs and simultaneously save money. Newcomb gives the real-life example of a husband and wife who argued about how much money he spends on his boat each year. His needs are about self-actualization: He enjoys the wind in his hair and the sun on his face. She seeks safety and security, which are also important to her quality of life. Here, the husband found a new strategy: offering sailing lessons to teens at his yacht club, which helped offset the cost of his boat and allowed his wife to funnel that additional income into savings. There are other easy ways households can find extra money without sacrificing much, Sun said. For example, households with more than one streaming service can opt to use one service for six months then change to another for the next six months, decreasing their streaming budget by 50%, she said. Households with an ample emergency fund intact can consider shopping for auto and other insurance policies with a higher deductible than their current policy, likely lowering monthly premiums, Sun said. In the event of an insurance claim, the emergency fund can meet the deductible, she said. They can also commit to doing curbside pickup when shopping for groceries, for example. Shoppers make purchases more mindfully and avoid in-store impulse buying, Sun said. She finds clients generally save 20% to 25% or more on their groceries this way. Any additional cash flow can immediately be used to pay down debt, or go into long-term savings or toward a short-term goal, she said. Ultimately, if there is a money issue, she challenges clients to decrease their spending by 5% to 10% during the month. After each week of success, she encourages them to celebrate by making memories instead of debt: perhaps by doing something with friends, or hanging out at a park, beach or someone's backyard. ""You have to have a joy to replace that negative,"" she said. ",,2024-04-07,,People hate budgeting. Here’s why — and how to reframe it

<p>From a list of 34 risks, the WEF report identifies mis- and disinformation as the top threats to global stability over the next two years and the fifth most dangerous threats over the next 10 years. <strong>Of particular concern is false information that could affect elections, democratic processes, and social cohesion in various countries worldwide, as well as sentiment contradicting the “consensus” narrative about climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Echoing these same concerns, the United Nations (UN), <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/"">its strategic partner</a> in advancing the climate-focused <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda"">2030 Agenda</a> for Sustainable Development, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/disinformation-hate-artificial-intelligence-united-nations-6f3081ae39bfabc362588c5518df2793"">has previously stated</a> much of the same.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/our-common-agenda-policy-brief-information-integrity-en.pdf""><em>Information Integrity on Digital Platforms</em></a>, a June 2023 UN policy brief recommending a code of conduct for digital platforms, Secretary-General António Guterres stated:</p>

<p>All the UN’s 2030 Agenda plans, activities, and expenditures are based on the belief that we face an existential climate crisis caused by human activity and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This conviction is clearly outlined in <a href=""https://shareverified.com/2023/11/23/mythbusters-climate-change-is-a-hot-topic-get-the-facts-here/"">a fact sheet</a> produced by <a href=""https://shareverified.com/"">Verified</a>, a joint initiative of the United Nations and <a href=""https://www.purpose.com/"">Purpose</a>, launched in 2020 to respond to mis- and disinformation about “intersecting crises like COVID-19 and climate change.” The document states unequivocally that:</p>

</ol><p><strong>By stating that disinformation is undermining these supposed scientific facts, Guterres rests his entire argument on the premise that each of the above statements is absolutely, indisputably, and undeniably true.</strong> Like Guterres, all who espouse this climate narrative have no tolerance for any opinion, theory, or evidence that runs contrary to this dogged notion.</p>

It has an extensive <a href=""https://shareverified.com/collaborators/"">list of major media collaborators</a> such as Al Jazeera, Clear Channel, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, TikTok, and Twitter. Melissa Fleming, Verified co-founder and current UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, has made it known that <a href=""https://youtu.be/mNbeYLHcGWM?si=y_4UvmPuT3Qxh_ON"">social media is a huge threat</a> to climate science and other UN initiatives and is particularly <a href=""https://youtu.be/Chu3T6CTaV4?si=tEmltIILp9H2K99v&amp;t=340"">bothered by Twitter/X</a> for allowing rampant disinformation.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear from these reports that any dissent from the established climate narrative threatens the advancement of the UN’s 17 <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs). </strong>Now, urgent calls to extinguish these threats have been issued so they can proceed with transforming the world unimpeded.</p>

<p>While many of the issues expressed in the <em>Information Integrity </em>report are legitimate and concerning, the UN via the World Health Organization (WHO) participates in disinformation by continuing to <a href=""https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines"">promote COVID-19 vaccines</a> as <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines"">safe and effective</a>, when they have largely been proven to be <a href=""https://expose-news.com/2022/05/18/how-harmful-is-my-covid-vaccine-batch/"">ineffective and cause much harm</a>. Their stance regarding climate change could also qualify as disinformation to the <a href=""http://www.petitionproject.org/"">thousands of scientists</a> who oppose this view but are being discredited as mere conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>The following statement from the report underscores their frustration with “climate deniers” and the platforms they use to oppose the UN’s agenda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>…mis- and disinformation about the cli­mate emergency are delaying urgently needed action to ensure a liveable future for the planet. Climate mis- and disinformation can be under­stood as false or misleading content that <strong>un­dercuts the scientifically agreed basis for the existence of human-induced climate change</strong>, its causes and impacts. Coordinated campaigns are seeking to deny, minimize or distract from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientific consensus and derail urgent action to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. <strong>A small but vocal minority of climate science de­nialists</strong> continue to reject the consensus po­sition and command an outsized presence on some digital platforms.”<br /><cite>(p. 12, emphasis added)</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Globalists want conformity regarding climate change and will go to extreme lengths to marginalize, censor, and discredit dissenters. They talk a good game about enforcing <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"">universal freedom of expression</a>, but on climate and other issues vital to their agenda, free speech is not tolerated. Though they readily acknowledge that controlling information may lead to greater levels of authoritarianism, surveillance, censorship, and the erosion of human rights, it seems they are willing to overlook these offenses to protect their precious climate agenda.</p>

<p>If they can successfully shut down debate about climate change, then soon any topic that threatens their aims will be off limits. The UN deems itself a protector of human rights but plays a major role in the media-censorship complex. Its attempts at crushing opposition to the climate narrative betrays their mission and reveals authoritarian tendencies.</p>

<p>The basis for their report stems from use of “an AI based model called <strong>CARDS</strong>,” short for <strong>Computer-Assisted Recognition of Climate Change Denial and Skepticism</strong>. CARDS is designed to identify and categorize climate denialist claims in text. The researchers used CARDS to analyze YouTube video transcripts from 96 mostly right-wing, conservative leaning channels including prominent ones like BlazeTV, Jordan Peterson, and the Heartland Institute.</p>

<p>CCDH has a big gripe with social media companies they believe are not doing enough to stem the tide of rising climate denial. They want to eliminate the ability for any “climate denier” spreading “conspiracy theory statements” to financially benefit from their content, as evidenced in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>To support the global efforts to avert climate disaster, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and X <strong>should all demonetize and de-amplify New Denial content</strong>. Demonetizing climate denial removes the economic incentives underpinning its creation and protects advertisers from bankrolling harmful content. Moreover, de-amplifying climate denial limits its reach and visibility, allowing time for fact-checking and other protective measures to be applied where content is clearly contrary to the well-established scientific consensus on climate change”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>

<p><em>CCDH polling on social media usage tested respondents’ agreement with <strong>conspiracy theory statements</strong>, including the statement: “Humans are not the main cause of global temperature increases.” CCDH found that 43% of adults and 56% of teenagers who report high activity on social media expressed agreement with that statement. This link between social media usage and <strong>conspiracist belief</strong> illustrates why urgent action is needed to prioritize information integrity on digital platforms in climate policymaking”<br /><cite>p. 34; emphasis added</cite></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Their demonetization and censorship recommendations come even after admitting that the CARDS model is only <em>up to 78% accurate</em>, could <em>not perform any fact checks</em> on the claims made in the transcripts, and that lack of punctuation caused <em>results to be skewed</em>.</strong></p>

<p>The CCDH is a <a href=""https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/center-for-countering-digital-hate/"">sketchy</a>, UK-based, advocacy group that has produced various reports inciting censorship against those they disagree with. Their <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/?_sft_topic=anti-vaxx-misinformation#results"">efforts against “anti-vaxxers”</a> culminated in several reports that led to the deplatforming, demonetizing, and discrediting of many individuals and organizations exposing pandemic-related fraud and COVID-19 vaccine falsehoods.</p>

<p>CCDH’s <em>The</em> <em>New Climate Denial</em> report has been promoted through mainstream outlets like CNN, MSN, Yahoo, and USA Today. It could impact the cited individuals and organizations the same way it affected those targeted in its <a href=""https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/"">Disinformation Dozen</a> reports a few years ago. Though their stated mission is to “protect human rights and civil liberties online,” they practice the opposite by advocating the revocation of these rights for climate and vaccine narrative challengers.</p>

<h2>HOW THE MEDIA-CENSORSHIP COMPLEX PLANS TO TACKLE CLIMATE DISSENT</h2>

<p>Two things are very clear from the recent reports issued by the WEF, UN, and CCDH. One, is that climate skepticism is on the rise. The second, is that they are threatened by the very existence of those who dare to refute their narrative. Many strategies to stem the tide of climate cynicism have already been employed with new ones currently being tested.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS CLIMATE SCIENCE BECOME NONDEBATABLE?</h2>

<p>If it wasn’t apparent before, it should now be crystal clear that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership"">vast empire</a> united against those questioning the climate narrative. They are determined to perpetuate the myth that there is universal consensus on the facts.</p>

<p>The truth is there is <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/new-poll-debunks-97-consensus-myth-on-climate-change/"">no real consensus</a> on <a href=""https://iaindavis.com/the-climate-science-is-settled-any-questions-part-1/"">climate science</a>. The UN and its network of public-private partnerships (PPP) just make it seem that way. In this regard, the UN climate stance is akin to <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/11/anthony-fauci-i-am-the-science/"">Anthony Fauci’s claim</a> that questioning him was like questioning science itself. Honest and open debate on the issue should be continued by allowing opponents opportunities to present their case without fear of censorship, harassment, exclusion, or cancellation. Instead, there is constant reinforcement of a fictional consensus while divergent opinions are labeled as dangerous conspiracies.</p>

<p>Climate consensus figures as high as <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024"">97</a> and even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans"">99.9</a> percent have been touted by former US Presidents, researchers, and media outlets in the past. But is this claim true? If it were, then why would there be so much effort to silence a mere one to three percent who deviate from the scientific echo chamber? Would all these battles be worth the time, energy, and money being spent on just <em>a few</em> dissidents, as they claim?</p>

The industry is rigged to favor researchers who set out to prove “official” claims. Funding and publication are often withheld from those who do not toe this line. As a result, statistics are skewed to make it seem like there is universal consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Past research <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/31/mark-lynas-99-consensus-on-climate-change-busted-in-peer-review/"">has demonstrated</a> claims of scientific consensus on climate change to be fraudulent.</strong> In a <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215"">paper published in 2023</a>, a team of researchers disproved the conclusions reached in a <a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966"">2021 study</a> claiming there was greater than 99% consensus on climate science in peer-reviewed scientific literature.</p>

<p>The claims were refuted by demonstrating that studies expressing neutral opinions were misclassified and papers communicating skepticism were ignored. This clear case of academic malfeasance is not the only example where scientists used <a href=""https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/08/30/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">falsified research</a> and <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-whistle-blower-details-how-scientists-conspire-to-depublish-non-consensus-papers/"">conspired</a> to silence those contradicting the alleged consensus. Even if the 99% consensus assertions were valid, the notion of <a href=""https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-expert-the-weaponization-of-scientific-consensus/"">consensus-as-truth</a> does not pass the test for authentic scientific validation. The majority can still be wrong.</p>

<p>A recent article <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/revealed-the-climate-denial-network-behind-classic-astroturf-farmers-campaign/"">posted by The Good Men Project</a>, which “exposed” the climate deniers behind the recent farmer protests in Europe, proclaimed that <em>“Scientific </em><a href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966""><em>consensus</em></a><em> on human-caused climate change is equivalent to that </em><a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/""><em>on evolution</em></a><em>.</em>” This statement came in response to a request from protest organizer James Melville for a national debate on climate and net zero policies. Never mind that evolution is not a <a href=""https://www.icr.org/article/secrets-evolution/"">proven fact.</a> Equating climate change to evolution shows it is also unproven and can be argued against. Again, the majority can still be wrong!</p>

But why is it that the powers that be would rather falsify research, smear dissenters, and spend billions of dollars to silence critics rather than continuing to debate the issues?</strong></p>

<p>An <a href=""https://co2coalition.org/2021/10/31/97-consensus-what-consensus/"">article written by Gregory</a> Whitstone, Executive Director of the CO2 Coalition, presents a valid argument for continued scientific debate on climate change, stating:</p>

<p><strong>You have likely heard that 97% of scientists agree on human-driven climate change. You may also have heard that those who don’t buy into the climate-apocalypse mantra are science-deniers. The truth is that a whole lot more than 3% of scientists are skeptical of the party line on climate. A whole lot more…</strong></p>

<p>There are some scientific truths that are quantifiable and easily proven, and with which, I am confident, at least 97% of scientists agree. Here are two:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>Carbon dioxide concentration has been increasing in recent years.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Temperatures, as measured by thermometers and satellites, have been generally increasing in fits and starts for more than 150 years.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>What is impossible to quantify is the actual percentage of warming that is attributable to increased anthropogenic (human-caused) CO2. There is no scientific evidence or method that can determine how much of the warming we’ve had since 1900 that was directly caused by us.</p>

<p>We know that temperature has varied greatly over the millennia. We also know that for virtually all of that time, global warming and cooling were driven entirely by natural forces, which did not cease to operate at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The claim that most modern warming is attributable to human activities is scientifically insupportable. The truth is that we do not know. We need to be able to separate what we do know from that which is only conjecture.</p>

<p>How can greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 be the sole agent <a href=""https://dailysceptic.org/2024/01/29/new-paper-argues-carbon-dioxide-causes-much-less-warming-than-is-commonly-believed/"">causing rising temperatures</a> when it is an essential element for all life forms? Given the growing world population, it seems that greater levels of CO2would lead to greater benefits. Plants need CO2 to thrive, yet the fight against it is accelerating.</p>

<p>Scientists have now stated that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/"">cow burps and farts</a> and even human <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12859057/Now-scientists-say-BREATHING-bad-environment-Gases-exhale-contribute-0-1-UKs-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"">breathing are bad for the environment</a> because they contribute to the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, both believed to contribute to global warming. This is beyond absurd!</p>

<p><em><strong>We are on the slippery slope to a dystopian nightmare if the trend toward censorship and marginalization continues.

Young adults, especially, are becoming more conscious about buying pieces that can survive more than one season, according to Thomaï Serdari, professor of marketing and director of the fashion and luxury program at New York University's Stern School of Business.

"Social Security beneficiaries who owe money to the Social Security Administration may see much lower default withholding rates from their monthly checks, thanks to As of March 25, the Social Security Administration Instead, the agency will collect either 10% of a beneficiary's total monthly benefit or $10 — whichever is greater. But there may be a short period where beneficiaries are still affected by the old policy, the agency announced Friday. If that happens, affected beneficiaries should call the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213 More from Personal Finance: The new rules apply to overpayments, which are triggered when the amount of benefits due is miscalculated and checks are sent for higher sums than what beneficiaries are owed. When that happens, the Social Security Administration is required by law to seek repayment of the excess money paid to beneficiaries. But it might not be clear that an overpayment has happened for years, sometimes resulting in overpayment notices for tens of thousands of dollars. In recent years, the problem with overpayments has become worse, said David Camp, CEO at the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives. ""There were always far too many overpayments,"" Camp said, as the agency has struggled over the years with limited or outdated resources. ""Although in the last few years, it's been a steady, though shockingly high, sum total of overpaid individuals."" Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, beneficiaries who face strict limits on their income and assets are particularly vulnerable to overpayment issues, Camp said. The Social Security Administration said it is working to curb the burden to affected beneficiaries. ""We are no longer going to have that clawback cruelty of intercepting 100% of a payment if people do not respond to our notice,"" Commissioner Martin O'Malley said during recent testimony before the Senate. While the new repayment threshold applies to new overpayments, beneficiaries who currently have an overpayment withholding rate greater than 10% can contact the Social Security Administration to have that lowered, the agency said. All affected beneficiaries should call the agency about the 10% repayment rate, Camp said, but they need to approach the process with patience. The Social Security Administration does not have enough staff to answer a high volume of calls, so beneficiaries should expect a hold time, Camp said, as well as processing time. The Social Security Administration is also implementing other new policies to address overpayments, including shifting the burden of proof away from Social Security claimants when determining who is at fault for the error. The maximum time for repayment plans is being extended to 60 months, up from 36 months. It will also be easier for beneficiaries to request a waiver so they don't have to pay back the sums. ""The great majority of claimants never request a waiver, although many of them could qualify,"" Camp said. That's particularly true for beneficiaries who are struggling to meet their basic needs or who are at risk of being evicted because they are repaying Social Security, he said. ""Claimants ought to know that they can also ask for not having to pay it back at all if it wasn't their fault and they can't afford to repay,"" Camp said. To request a waiver, a beneficiary must Since O'Malley was sworn in as commissioner in December, he has taken some ""very aggressive steps"" toward addressing the overpayment issues that vex beneficiaries, said Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. ""They're so reasonable, it makes you wonder why no one did it before,"" said Richtman, referring especially to the end of the policy of withholding all of a beneficiary's monthly payments until the entire overpaid sum is repaid. ""That's a huge burden on most beneficiaries who live on Social Security or the majority of their income is Social Security,"" Richtman said.

Would-be homebuyers need to earn $113,520 a year to afford the typical house in the U.S. That is 35% more than what the typical household earns annually, which is $84,072, according to a ""Since the pandemic, affordability has just totally collapsed,"" said Chen Zhao, a senior economist at Redfin. February 2021 was the last month when the typical household earned more money than it needed to afford the median home. There's been a deficit ever since, Zhao said. More from Personal Finance: ""That deficit hit a peak in October of 2023,"" she added. ""The reason why it hit a peak then is because that's when mortgage rates peaked as well."" Meanwhile, home prices also remained high because of an inventory crunch: the median sale price for a house was $412,778 in February 2024, according to Redfin. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, The average household fell short $29,448 to afford a home in February, The affordability deficit narrowed because mortgage rates have been on a consistent decline since the last peak in October, according to Zhao. At that peak, the average 30-year fixed ""It's been a pretty big change since last October,"" Zhao said. Other reasons such as seasonal pricing may be reflected, as home prices tend to decline in the winter months, said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. However, potential buyers are still on the sidelines, said Veronica Fuentes, a certified financial planner at Northwestern Mutual. ""They're either holding off or they're taking their time,"" she said. Recent layoffs in the technology industry have affected some of her clients' attitudes, Fuentes said. While her clients may not be on the chopping block, seeing their co-workers get laid off has made many of them more cautious. ""If you were laid off, could you still afford this mortgage? Do you have six months [of] emergency savings or even a year [of] emergency savings? ... Can you still afford the mortgage for six months if you have no job?"" Fuentes said. In a time when a potential buyer needs to earn about $114,000 a year to afford a median-priced house in the U.S., a starter home would make the most sense for price-sensitive buyers, experts say. A potential buyer should make about $76,000 a year to afford a Starter homes are hard to come by. Home builders over the past 15 years or so have moved away from building entry-level homes, said Ostrowski. For almost the entire second half of the 20th century, someone could buy a home for $120,000 in many parts of the U.S., he said. ""That just doesn't exist anymore,"" Ostrowski said. Buyers could seek lower costs in certain markets in the U.S. There are 13 metropolitan areas where buyers might afford the typical home without earning six figures, Redfin found. In Detroit, the typical household needed to earn $46,168 to afford the median-priced home in February, making it the most affordable market in the country. It was followed by Cleveland ($58,186), Pittsburgh ($61,603), St. Louis ($66,755) and Philadelphia ($73,182). The other metros where homebuyers making less than $100,000 can afford the typical home are Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Warren, Michigan; Kansas City, Missouri; Virginia Beach, Virginia; San Antonio, Texas, and Columbus, Ohio. Experts say borrowing New ""People are getting kind of tired of waiting, so we're starting to see a lot more inventory come on,"" Zhao said. However, take this with a grain of salt, Ostrowski said, as the outlook six months ago was very different from how things played out. ""If you're ready and you can afford it, buy now,"" he said. ""Conditions probably aren't going to get significantly better."" Indeed, while the combination of lower rates and boosted supply should help with affordability, ""it's not going to completely change the picture,"" said Zhao.

<p><em>“I may be crazy. But it’s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ~ Ivor Browne, Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at the University College Dublin [2017]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In an ideal and perfect world, all Americans would be following a righteously guided conscience and their better angels, and they could trust that their elected leaders were doing likewise; but, we live in a far from perfect world or society, and the fools of the country have abandoned Christian kindness, the Golden Rule and humanity for the evil of trans-humanism. </strong>Heartwarming words advocating for true freedom and liberty are far and few between in today’s society and political arenas, in a manner not too unlike the years between 1850 and 1860 that led to the Civil War; and tho’ some on both side of the political aisle still exude goodness in a way that makes each day seem a bit brighter, by and large, the Democratic Party has been completely infiltrated by Marxist-Maoist Communists, who are driving the nation towards the darkest tyranny and bloodiest days ever witnessed in America, as they attempt to stamp out the tenderness and beauty in each person’s soul and reduce us all to mere mindless cogs in their authoritarian machine.</p>

<p>Look around. <strong>Half or more of America’s citizenry have lost their minds and are six steps or more removed from reality,</strong> either due to the mind-numbing communist indoctrination they have absorbed from their “education” in the public school system, something genetic or a trauma from their life, some new maniacal drug that has them hooked and out of their minds, or a combination of all three.</p>

<p>Some would suggest that we set about immediately reforming public education to promote and defend the ideas that originally built America, but we don’t have time to change hearts and minds to counter a movement that started over a hundred years ago and now sits on the cusp of being able to solidify its current stranglehold on America, if the tide swings its way in the 2024 Election or they are able to steal the election through current fraud facilitating mechanisms. Although we can still move to properly educate the next generation in a newly reformed education system or through homeschool, now is the time to organize and assemble those within the country who already know and hold to the truth of American principles and all the freedom and liberty that follow — time to gather our like-minded American patriots and those Lions of Liberty who have had enough of witnessing this America we love so well so sorely abused, put upon and assaulted.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t help when we have self-serving, corrupt people in high office promising to save the gullible and ill-informed from their hell and the misery it brings</strong>, if only they will support more madness to be placed in U.S. code. Vote for more economy killing “climate change” change regulations and initiatives and “we’ll put more money on your EBT cards, courtesy of Uncle Sam and the American taxpayer”. “Help us make sure the government has the final say over everybody’s children and can kill babies as they exit the birthing canal, and we’ll make certain you get privilege over all other Americans”, one can almost hear Traitor Joe whispering in some dimly lit concert hall. “You can be a champion among champions”, they say — “Let us help you change your gender”.</p>

<p><strong>And if anyone stands in your way in the pursuit of any evil, it is they who will be called evil and fallen upon by the full weight of the U.S. Federal Government.</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea. And as if that isn’t bad enough, Biden is now moving as fast as he can to forgive $144 billion more in student loans. He plans to announce this on Monday, April 8th 2024, and for anyone with eyes to see, this is simply corruption at its worst and Biden buying votes in the upcoming presidential election. What a slap in the face of Americans who couldn’t afford to go to college but now will be forced to bear the tax burden this move will bring.</p>

<p>I see the immorality growing every day, the people who revel in its evil, freaks from some futuristic sideshow that bodes ill and speaks to the destruction of humanity. and with each passing day, I find myself moving farther and farther away from those with whom I have little or nothing in common with, adrift from most of humanity too. Not in any manner that lends itself to any sadness over my situation, but rather as if to say “whew” in a realization of the relief that has come by way of my separation from those I despise most.</p>

<p><strong>It’s sort of like I’m standing on the river bank watching the “ship of fools” sailing over the river falls in denial of their own mortality, thinking their crazy ideas will save them and hold them invincible, or worse, knowing they are going to die and not caring who they drag to Hell along with them.</strong> They think we’re crazy for defending America’s righteous and true founding principles and virtues and the liberty associated with them, and we think them mad for denying God, reality and the best mankind has to offer in exchange for an evil, unrestrained, immoral freedom that is no freedom at all, a bringer of Death.</p>

<p>Since 1965, the communists within the federal government, Congress and many state and local governments have essentially separated us and pitted us against one another as one aggrieved group or another, some special interest and through identity politics and racial hatred. They broke us into tribes and acted as if the represented each, all the while setting in place mechanisms that made us serfs to the government, The Leviathan, and reducing us all to poverty as they have gradually destroyed the bulk of the middle class in our country. The Constitution is so degraded and eroded now that any tyrant can impose his will by way of one flourish of a pen, which Traitor Joe has done through 118 executive orders, bypassing Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We have a national debt that’s rapidly approaching $35 trillion and counting, that to be sure rests on the shoulders of both parties, but it <strong>couldn’t have arrived to this abysmal point without both Marxist-Maoists and RINOs accepting the tenets of the Marxist-Keynesian Modern Monetary Theory and the notion that any one nation could print and borrow an endless supply of money forever without any terrible consequence, which is currently being proven wrong.</strong> Our people struggle to pay for food and rent and new high mortgage rates have put home ownership out of reach for this new Generation Z that is coming up and expecting a successful way of life to be attainable in some form or fashion, even tho’ many of them are a great part of the problem, some thirty percent claiming to be either queer themselves or supportive of the LGBTQ sickness running rampant through American society, advocating for every known sexual perversion and deviancy one might care to mention.</p>

<p>Several decades ago, I realized every government in the world was using a Keynesian debt-based system, printing money as if there was no end to real assets or backing for it. <strong>Basically, the world had gone mad, as the greed of its so-called “leaders” knew no bounds, and the various governments of the world basically accepted the use of monopoly money. </strong>The charade is ongoing and the casino open, that is, ’til those at the very top decide to call in their markers and usher in the final forced phase of The Great Reset.</p>

<p>In 2008, as I watched the near total collapse of our economic system and heard George [Bush] say that we had to temporarily abandon the free market capitalist system in order to save it, I received a strong sense that America may have peaked and was as good as it was going to get from there on out. I had a feeling that things were only going to continue to decline, especially as one major corporation after the next receive a taxpayer funded bailout after being deemed “too big to fail”.</p>

<p>In unbelievable fashion, when the largest economic collapse in U.S. history hit in March 2020, to be followed by the Covid Lockdowns, pushed and kept going for years by traitors to America, such as Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, many of us saw it for the fraud it was. Still, whole swaths of our cultural freedoms and norms were very nearly destroyed, as a timid American people complied, by and large, because they couldn’t simply stand on their hind feet and tell the government despots “NO”. Even now, as many careers no longer exist and jobs are disappearing like cotton-candy on a rainy day, far too many, especially the communists among us, hold to the delusion that all is well and deny that out-of-control spending and massive national debt really do matter for the health of the nation’s economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have possibly known at the time — other than those Deep State bad actors behind the curtain — that this was a dire harbinger of things to come and but one of the first precursors to a validation of this current system of economic fascism as the preeminent and defining feature of what everyone still mistakenly calls our “free market capitalist system”. </strong>Who knew that — if one believes Obama and now Biden — the cure for debt was more debt; the cure for greed was more greed, and that envy of the neighbors’ possessions was perfectly acceptable, even if one easily walked on over to take them by force, through armed robbery. And who could have foreseen that every Marxist-Maoist of the Democratic Party would become modern day Jezebels, condemning the innocent by way of one false accusation after another, paving the way for a vile new phenomena and way of life for the misguided youth of America.</p>

<p>But never in my wildest imagination did I expect to see every single government institution corrupted to its very core and heavily infiltrated by men and women seeking to destroy traditional America — to “transform America” — and bring great harm to all Americans in the process, as evil was called “good” and good was called “evil”, turning the world upside down as foretold in Isaiah 5:20, as we all witnessed in 2020, driven by the Democratic Party Communists and fascists and globalists of the country, for the most part. Never did I expect to see U.S. science so corrupted and in denial of real science, reality itself, as supposedly “educated” people were soon trying to convince the entire nation that men could really become women and women could become men — that men actually have periods and can have babies.</p>

<p>And as <strong>the American people continue to fail to mount a strong and passionate rejection or effective defense against the current climate change directives from the Biden regime,</strong> the Biden regime has just recently [January 26th] ordered our international export of natural gas and natural gas extraction to be placed on hold; and it’s still on hold as of this writing [April 5th], while its impact on the environment is further scrutinized. And in the meantime, the movement towards greater control over our society by way of a digital currency is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Biden regime is going to be able to control much of anything once they completely destroy America’s energy infrastructure and our efficacy as an worldwide energy powerhouse, as we were under the Trump administration. It’s going to be damned difficult to control anything without electricity, fossil fuels or heat, and all hell will be unleashed once Americans start being forced to sit in the dark, shivering in the cold or sweltering in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>When I hear Rachel “Mad-Cow” Maddow and Chris “Cry-baby” Matthews talking about Republicans who support Trump being members of a cult with “crazy ideas”, I think how ironic, that they are perfectly describing themselves and their ilk. </strong>They are so insane that they don’t even recognize themselves in that description or what it is that they don’t know; they call themselves “the normal people” as their despot leader, Traitor Joe, dismantles and tears the American republic down around the shoulders of all Americans.</p>

<p>In listening to many proponents of the Democratic Party Communist platform and agenda — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer for three in particular — I cannot help but wonder when did the wards for the mentally ill release all the inmates. And so here we are in America, where the inmates of mental institutions, federal prisons, Illegal Aliens, drug dealers and sexual deviants and child predators are running the country and the Oval Office today.</p>

<p><strong>I have noted in several past articles, I do believe the “united States” is currently hurling down a path on a fast track to a full blown, hot civil war. </strong>What will emerge will either be a nation squashed under an iron-fisted communist government or a people united in freedom and liberty under a limited government, restrained from ever growing or overreaching as the current Federal System has allowed and the Biden regime has done, trampling on the entire Constitution and our Inalienable God-given Rights in the process.</p>

<p>Although I refuse to accept any excuse for the far-reaching, incredible and massive ignorance of so many of my countrymen in this day of the internet and information, with books aplenty in every public library too, there are an unbelievable number who accumulate scores, even hundreds, of bits and pieces of the bigger picture without the ability or the will to put them together to reach any worthwhile conclusion aimed at formulating a proper course of action to resist this current totalitarian-minded movement and save themselves, their families and communities and America herself. They do not currently seem to have any real sense of urgency, unless one looks at leadership in Texas and Florida and the current manufactured border crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Twenty-five state governors stood alongside Governor Abbot of Texas in the border dispute with the Biden regime,</strong> and the Governor of South Carolina sent his own National Guardsmen to the border to assist the Texas National Guard and Texas’s various law enforcement agencies who are in this struggle for America’s survival. So although I was speaking of the average citizen in the preceding paragraph, there are some holding key positions who see the rapidly approaching existential threats to all America and are reacting with a high level of urgency and accordingly, using everything within their power to stop this one segment of the madness emanating from the Biden regime.</p>

<p>America has been cleaved into two separate and antithetical ideologies — two opposing worldviews — with the communists and radical takers of the country supporting a dark vision of tyranny and the conservatives and independent producers supporting the light of truth and a vision of freedom and liberty. They are both hanging in the balance and waiting for gravity or some monumental event to throw the lever that moves them to act and take the country by storm, with the Democrats willing to use every illegal means imaginable.</p>

<p>The heavy infiltration of Illegal Aliens from many foreign countries that are unfriendly or outright enemies of America is one more dynamic and issue of concern for all who love America, since they will certainly come down on the side which is trying to destroy America. <strong>No one should be oblivious to the fact that various “sleeper cells” of Hamas and Hezbollah have been in America for several decades now. </strong>Taken in conjunction with thousands of military aged Chinese men entering the country illegally the coming chaos will be Biblical in proportion to anything we have witnessed in all American history.</p>

<p>Nineteenth century French economist and writer, Frederic Bastiat could have been speaking of America today and the situation She currently finds Herself, as he once stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“When misguided public opinion honors what is despicable and despises what is honorable, punishes virtue and rewards vice, encourages what is harmful and discourages what is useful, applauds falsehood and smothers truth under indifference or insult, a nation turns its back on progress and can be restored only by the terrible lessons of catastrophe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans from all across the country have either been <strong>complicit in this current treason to “fundamentally transform America”, into something strange and foreign to the Founding, or they have simply been so complacent as to allow the country to fall to her enemies-from-within</strong>, in a manner that’s proving fairly damned tough to counter for the moment due to a litany of reasons, from lawfare against conservative and independent patriots to the outright targeting of American patriots by the FBI and the DOJ. But basically, the nation is just about to reap the full, terrible consequences of what was sown so many decades ago, and everyone had better prepare as best as they can.</p>

<p>We can’t stop what is headed down the road towards us, no matter if we stopped all unnecessary spending or the invasion at the border today — not if we outlawed all deviancy, abuse of children through gender assignment and men competing in women’s sports, or started drilling for oil and gas like crazy overnight. <strong>The die has been cast, and no one single man or woman, sitting in the Oval Office, can change what is coming, not Trump or RFK, JR or anyone else who wants to give it a try.</strong></p>

<p>All good and decent Americans, who can still remember what America used to be or who have been well taught from childhood and know what a great nation — an exceptional nation — She has been in years gone by, will soon be forced to fight against enemies-from-within and foreign enemies supported by the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, so that our friends, families and communities can survive this period and freedom and liberty shall not perish in our land. And as we fight, we must pray and hope that our side emerges victoriously from the din and cacophony of the conflagration and chaos, in order that we may purge the land of those who hate America and restore Her to a land that truly understands what “equality under the law” actually means, to be governed in a manner that actually defends and protects the Inalienable God-given Rights for all, restoring America as something better than She has been in a long, long time.</p>

<p><strong>This is the war that lays ahead of us, looming just over the horizon, and our very lives and the lives of our loved ones depend on our success. The death of America as She has stood is guaranteed, unless liberty-minded patriots rise from the ashes of the next civil war. That is the reality and the future we now must face.</strong></p>

"The stock market could hit a milestone if the Dow Jones Industrial Average However, even as stocks have climbed higher, investors are worried there could be a pullback, financial advisors say. They're not alone in those concerns. A ""It does feel like we're at an inflection point where things could go either way,"" said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. After a mostly uninterrupted market rally over the past four or five months, it would not be surprising to see a pullback, said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. That would more likely come in the form of a temporary correction rather than a prolonged bear market, he said. For investors who have gravitated toward cash, certificates of deposit, or bonds, a pullback may be an opportunity to deploy those funds in the market, Kourkafas said. If you're investing toward your retirement or other life goals, it's best to avoid trying to time the market, said Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner and the CEO and founder of ""The stock market is a long-term investment,"" said Jenkin, who is also a member of Investors are jittery that the presidential election results may throw the markets off track, But experts say those worries are misguided. ""It is really very hard to find any evidence in the data that politics is a long-term determinant of market performance,"" Kourkafas said. However, there may be increased volatility in the months preceding the election, he said. What's unique this time around is we are already familiar with both of the likely candidates — current President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump — and the markets have performed equally well under both leaders, he said. Instead, the outlook may depend more on other factors such as interest rates, corporate earnings and economic growth, he said. Financial advisors including Louis Barajas, a CFP and enrolled agent, said their clients are concerned the election may affect their portfolios. ""I tell them, 'Listen, presidents come, presidents go, the economy's going to change. But in the long term, the market tends to be up,'"" said Barajas, who is CEO of Barajas said he steers his clients to focus on their personal goals rather than on outside events. Today's market uncertainty is a reminder of the value of humility, said Morningstar's Benz. And the best way to express humility in portfolios is to diversify, she said. ""No matter what happens, we're reasonably well protected,"" Benz said. For young investors, that may mean moving away from U.S. stocks to non-U.S. holdings, she said. That may be done through a fund that reflects global market capitalization, such as the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF. Older investors may want to take advantage of higher fixed-income yields and add safer assets to their portfolios, she said. That can include cash and short- and intermediate-term high-quality bonds to build a runway to spend from, even if stocks do go down. ""You can have a safer portfolio and expect to earn a decent rate of return today,"" Benz said. If you're already in retirement and spending from your portfolio, it's worth having those safeguards in place. Finding the right mix of assets will depend on your personal timeline. For financial goals that aren't at least five years away, it makes no sense to invest in the stock market, Jenkin said. To test your own portfolio allocation based on your age, Jenkin suggested following the rule of 120 – subtract your age from that number to find out how you should be invested. So if you're 60 years old, for example, a 60% allocation to stocks may make sense. When it comes to revisiting your portfolio allocations, it's wise to set your own schedule rather than react to market or other news events. ""Make a plan to do that once a year or so,"" Benz said.

Top sources of that stress include several factors outside consumers' control, including Boosting your money knowledge can be empowering, members of the ""Financial education is like being able to swim,"" said Annamaria Lusardi, founder and academic director of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center, or GFLEC. ""It's a good skill and it becomes of particular importance when you end up in a storm."" There's no one set definition for financial security. ""It means different things to different people, and it means different things to different people at different parts of our lives,"" said Laura Levine, president and CEO of the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy. Depending on who you ask, it might mean feeling peace of mind about your money situation, earning enough to both cover bills and save for the future, or having resources to weather an unexpected expense. ""Getting to a place of financial security for some is just having some dollars put away for emergencies,"" said Billy J. Hensley, president and CEO of the National Endowment for Financial Education, or NEFE. ""That goes a long way to relieving stress."" Among U.S. respondents in the CNBC survey, some of the most common components to feeling financially secure included having no outstanding debts (59%), accumulating ""high levels"" of savings (47%) and owning their own home (45%). When it comes to achieving that security, 44% of U.S. respondents said the most important part is spending less than you make, followed by 29% who point to having a steady, Just understanding that financial security is a highly personal goal — and one that doesn't necessarily require significant income or assets — can help you feel more secure, said Levine. For example, she said, if a person can say, ""I'm not a millionaire, but I can pay my bills and feed my family,"" that may represent financial security for them. Studies show that ""There is an important role for financial literacy here,"" said GFLEC's Lusardi, who is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and director of the Initiative for Financial Decision-Making.

"Managing one's personal finances can seem like a hodgepodge of never-ending checklists and rules of thumb. With all sorts of financial considerations vying for attention — Here are some of the biggest financial blind spots, according to several certified financial planners on CNBC's Digital Financial Consumers often don't understand the importance of their The score impacts how easily consumers can get a loan — like a mortgage, credit card or auto loan — and the interest rate they pay on that debt. The number generally ranges from 300 to 850. Credit agencies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion determine the score using a formula that accounts for Lenders are generally more willing to give loans and better interest rates to borrowers with credit scores in the mid- to high-700s or above, Let's say a consumer wants a $300,000 fixed mortgage for a 30-year term. The average person with a credit score between 760 and 850 would get a 6.5% interest rate, according to national FICO data as of April 1. By comparison, someone with a score of 620 to 639 would get an 8.1% rate. The latter's monthly payment would cost $324 more relative to the person with a better credit score — amounting to an extra $116,000 over the life of the loan, according to FICO's Wills are basic They spell out who gets your money after you die. Wills can also stipulate who will take care of your kids and oversee your money until your children turn 18. Planning for such a grim event isn't fun — but it's essential, said Barry Glassman, CFP, founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services. ""I'm shocked by the number of well-to-do families with kids who have no will in place,"" Glassman said. Without such a legal document, state courts Taking it a step further, individuals can create trusts, which can assign more control over details like the age at which children gain access to inherited funds, Glassman said. Choosing how much money to stash away for a One household might need three months of savings while another might need a year, she said. Emergency funds include money to cover the necessities — like mortgage, rent, utility and grocery payments — in the event of an unexpected event like job loss. A single person should generally try to save at least six months' worth of emergency expenses, Elliott said. That's also true for married couples where both spouses work at the same company or in the same industry; the risk of a job loss occurring at or around the same time is relatively high, Elliott said. Meanwhile, a couple in which the spouses make a similar income but work in different fields and occupations may only need three months of expenses. If something unexpected happens to one spouse's employment, the odds are good that the couple can temporarily lean on the other spouse's income, she said. Business owners should aim to have at least a year of expenses saved since their income can fluctuate, as the Covid-19 pandemic showed, Elliott added. Tax withholding is a pay-as-you-go system. Employers estimate your annual tax bill and withhold tax from each paycheck accordingly. ""Ten out of 10 people couldn't explain how the tax withholding system works,"" said Ted Jenkin, CFP, CEO and founder of oXYGen Financial based in Atlanta. Employers partly base those withholdings on information workers supply on a W-4 form. Generally, taxpayers who get a refund during tax season withheld too much from their paychecks throughout the year. They receive those overpayments from the government via a refund. However, those who owe money to Uncle Sam didn't withhold enough to satisfy their annual tax bill and must make up the difference. People who owe money often blame their accountants or tax software instead of themselves, even though they can generally control how much is withheld, Jenkin said. Someone who owes more than $500 to $1,000 may want to change their withholding, Jenkin said. That goes for someone who gets a big refund as well; instead, they may wish to save (and earn interest on) that extra cash throughout the year, Jenkin said. Workers can fill out a new W-4 form to change their withholding. They may wish to do so upon any major life event like a marriage, divorce or birth of a child to avoid surprises come tax time. ""I think people underestimate how much money they're going to need in retirement,"" Elliott said. Many people assume their spending will decline when they retire, perhaps to roughly 60% to 70% of spending during their working years, she said. But that's not always the case. ""Yes, maybe the kids are out of the house but now that you're retired you have more time, meaning you have more time to do things,"" Elliott said. She asks clients to envision how they want to spend their lives in retirement — travel and hobbies, for example — to estimate how their spending might change. That helps guide overall savings goals. Households also don't often account for the potential need for long-term care, which can be costly, in their calculations, she said.

"There's a student loan forgiveness opportunity available to many borrowers, but they'll have to act by April 30 to qualify, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The U.S. Department of Education is conducting a one-time adjustment of borrowers' payments this summer, and those who ""The one-time adjustment is designed to count more of the payments you made, so they can be added to the payments required for cancellation,"" the CFPB says. Here's what to know. Income-driven repayment plans, Borrowers typically get any remaining debt forgiven after 10, 20 or 25 years, depending on the plan. One complicating factor for borrowers in these programs is that they often have multiple loans, taken out at different times, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. ""They get at least one new loan each year in school, on average,"" he said. That can mean a borrower has multiple timelines to forgiveness, one for each of those loans. More from Personal Finance: Now, the Biden administration is temporarily offering borrowers the chance to combine their loans and to get credit going back as far as their first loan payment on the oldest of their original loans in that bundle. This could be a good deal for many, experts say. For example, say a borrower graduated from college in 2004, took out more loans for a graduate degree in 2018 and is now in repayment under an income-driven plan with a 20-year timeline to forgiveness. Consolidating could lead them to immediately qualify for forgiveness on all of those loans, experts say, even though they'd normally need to wait at least another 14 years for full relief. Usually, a student loan consolidation restarts a borrowers' forgiveness timeline, making it a terrible move for those working toward cancellation. But the Biden administration has changed that program detail through April 30. All federal student loans are eligible for consolidation, including Federal Family Education Loans, Parent Plus loans and Perkins Loans, Kantrowitz said. You can apply for a ""So long as the application is submitted by April 30, they should be fine, even if the servicers take longer to process it,"" Kantrowitz said. Some borrowers who took out small amounts may even be eligible for cancellation after as few as 10 years' worth of payments, if they enroll in the new income-driven repayment option, known as the Consolidating your loans shouldn't increase your monthly payment, since your bill under an income-driven repayment plan is based on your earnings and not your total debt, Kantrowitz said. The new interest rate will be a weighted average of the rates across your loans. Before consolidating, it may be a good idea to get a complete payment history of each loan, so that you can later make sure you're getting the full credit you're entitled to, said You should be able to get a history of your payments at The payment history counts when your loans first entered repayment, not when the loan was borrowed, Rubin said.

""Today's decision looks to be relatively dovish,"" he said, given that both growth and inflation forecasts moved lower. ""That means that the ECB governing council is seeing growth as more sluggish and lower than what they saw it before... and also in terms of headline inflation and core inflation, the new projections are definitely weaker than the older ones.""

This comes as the labor force participation rate within the group — which measures how many workers are currently employed or searching for work — rises to 63.4% from 62.9%. Valerie Wilson, director at the Economic Policy Institute's Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy, said that the labor market is showing positive signs for Black women. She pointed to the decrease in the unemployment rate, while the employment/population ratio edged higher to 60.6% from 59.9%. ""That seems unambiguously that things are moving in a positive direction,"" she told CNBC. As for why the cohort was able to buck the trend, Wilson said it could be due to the specific industries that added jobs last month. ""We saw increases in health care and government services, which are sectors where we see a significant number of Black women being employed,"" she said. ""The fact that those were two sectors that added jobs and had the highest job growth in the last month is probably a factor in that increased participation rate and reduced unemployment rate."" For Hispanic women, unemployment rose to 5% from 4.3%. Overall, with the unemployment rate still sitting below 4%, this month's report paints the picture of a strong labor market, Wilson said.

The respective 12-month readings in January were 3.1% and 3.9%.

Markets were rattled in January when the ""While we do not expect the trend in inflation to re-accelerate this year, less clear progress over the next few months is likely to keep the Fed searching for more confidence that inflation is on course to return to target on a sustained basis,"" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, said in a recent client note. Energy prices had eased earlier in the winter, putting some downward pressure on headline readings. But Wells Fargo estimates that energy services rebounded 4% in February, leading to an increase at the pump, where a gallon of regular gas is up about 20 cents, or more than 6%, from a month ago, The bank also estimates that goods prices have held their ground despite an easing in supply chain pressures and pressure from higher interest rates. On the brighter side, the House said lower prices on travel, medical care and other services helped keep inflation in check. Still, Wells Fargo has raised its full-year inflation forecast. The bank's economists now expect core CPI to run at a 3.3% rate this year, up from the previous 2.8% estimate. Focusing on the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the preferred Fed gauge, Wells Fargo sees inflation at 2.5% for the year, versus a prior estimate of 2.2%.

It increased 0.95% when taking out restaurants as well, the Retail Monitor's core measure. Removing the effect of the leap day, sales rose 0.4%, or less than half of the unadjusted gain, but they were still up from the 0.2% decline in January. Taking out restaurants, the Retail Monitor adjusted for the leap day was up 0.3%, compared with a 0.04% gain in January.

Wall Street While the 12-month pace is off the inflation peak in mid-2022, it remains well above the Fed's 2% goal as the central bank approaches its two-day policy meeting in a week. Fed officials in recent weeks both have signaled that rate cuts are likely at some point this year and expressed caution about letting up too soon in the battle against high prices. The statement after the January meeting indicated that policymakers need ""greater confidence"" that inflation is moving back to target. Chair Jerome Powell, in congressional testimony last week, echoed those concerns, though he did mention that the Fed is probably ""not far"" from the point where it can start easing up on monetary policy. Tuesday's report ""leaves Fed officials some way from attaining the 'greater confidence' needed to begin cutting interest rates,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. For financial markets, the shift in the Fed stance from its apparent policy pivot in late 2023 has meant a repricing on the pace of rate cuts. Where futures traders entered the year expecting cuts to start coming in March, with six or seven total on the year, they have pushed out the first reduction to June, with two or three to follow, assuming cuts in quarter percentage point increments. A bustling economy has helped the Fed focus on incoming data and allowed policymakers to avoid having to rush to lower rates. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5% annualized pace in 2023 and is on pace to increase at a 2.5% pace in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker. One key ingredient in that growth has been a resilient consumer boosted by a strong labor market. The economy Such strength can be a double-edged sword: While the growth in the face of aggressive rate hikes has bought the Fed time on policy, it also raises concerns that inflation could be more durable than expected. Housing costs in particular have caused concern. Shelter comprises about one-third of the CPI weighting and has been slow to decelerate, at least according to the BLS measure. Fed officials see rental prices coming down through the year, and other measures outside the CPI computation of owners-equivalent rent have shown easing price pressures.

"The Swiss National Bank on Thursday surprised the market with a decision to lower its main policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.5%, saying national inflation is likely to stay below 2% for the foreseeable future. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the Swiss central bank to hold rates at 1.75%. ""For some months now, inflation has been back below 2% and thus in the range the SNB equates with price stability. According to the new forecast, inflation is also likely to remain in this range over the next few years,"" the bank said. Swiss inflation continued to fall in February, hitting 1.2%. The SNB also reduced its annual inflation forecasts. The bank now sees average inflation reaching 1.4% in 2024, down from its 1.9% estimate in December, and 1.2% for 2025, trimmed from the previous 1.6% estimate. Its first forecast for 2026 puts average inflation at 1.1% over the period. Following the announcement, analysts at Capital Economics said they expect two more SNB rate cuts over the course of this year, ""with the Bank sounding more dovish and inflation likely to undershoot its forecasts."" ""We think inflation will come in even lower than the new SNB forecasts imply and remain around the current level of 1.2% before falling to below 1.0% next year. Accordingly, we forecast the SNB to cut rates at the September and December meetings taking the policy rate to 1%, where we think it will remain throughout 2025 and 2026,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note. The September meeting is likely to be the last under the stewardship of SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan, who will step down at the end of that month after 12 years at the helm. The SNB said Swiss economic growth is ""likely to remain modest in the coming quarters,"" with the GDP poised to expand by roughly 1% this year. ""Our forecast for Switzerland, as for the global economy, is subject to significant uncertainty. The main risk is weaker economic activity abroad. Momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets has weakened noticeably in recent quarters,"" the SNB said. ""However, the vulnerabilities in these markets remain."" On a macro level, the SNB flagged ""moderate"" global economic growth in the coming quarters, along with likely falls in inflation partly thanks to restrictive monetary policy strategies. It nevertheless acknowledged ""significant risks"" and geopolitical tensions that could cloud the international economic horizon. In a TV interview with CNBC's Silvia Amaro, Jordan said that the improved inflation forecast has given the bank the breathing room to lower rates, but refused to be drawn on the inevitability of three cuts this year. ""We will see in June whether the situation is different, whether inflationary pressure continues to decline, then we'll make a new decision in June,"" he said, acknowledging that the bank remains ready to intercede in the foreign exchange market ""if necessary"" to defend the Swiss franc. High interest rates typically prop up currencies and weaken the relative value of other coins against them. ""We said very clearly that we remain ... available to intervene in the foreign exchange market, if necessary. So we can use this instrument in order to make sure that monetary conditions remain appropriate,"" Jordan noted. He fell short of commenting on whether other central banks will take a page from the SNB's trailblazing book and loosen their monetary policy, but signaled no concerns over the potential impact their moves may have on the Swiss currency. ""We will profit from a situation where we have price stability globally. Of course, it could have an impact on interest rate differentials, but I think a situation where the price stability is re-established everywhere, this is something that is positive for the global economy, and so also for Switzerland,"" he said. Switzerland is the first advanced economy to cut interest rates following a prolonged period of high inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on global trade and Russia's war in Ukraine. Switzerland was also affected by jitters in the banking space last year, when the government stepped in to facilitate Jordan on Thursday stressed to CNBC the importance of liquidity to the Swiss banking sector. ""A key message from us is always that they have to prepare their collateral, so that this collateral ... in case they need additional liquidity,"" he said. Asked whether Swiss lenders are doing enough in this direction, Jordan said there were ""very good discussions in Switzerland at the moment"" between banks and the SNB. ""The situation of March last year and also in the United States made it very clear also to smaller banks that liquidity issues could be a problem,"" he said. ""I think we are on the good way in order to make sure that sufficient collateral will be available in an emergency case ... but it's very important that we continue to go in that direction."" The Swiss National Bank's rate announcement emerged just before Norway's central bank refused to blink, ""The rate path we're presenting today indicates... an autumn rate cut, most likely in September,"" Norges Bank Governor Ida Wolden Bache told a press conference on Thursday, according to Reuters.

"European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde on Wednesday reiterated that policymakers will consider bringing interest rates down in June, but sketched an uncertain path beyond that. ""By June we will have a new set of projections that will confirm whether the inflation path we foresaw in our March forecast remains valid,"" Lagarde said in a speech in Frankfurt. The June meeting has been flagged as a potential turning point by many members of the ECB's Governing Council — which votes on rate moves — as it will be the first gathering for which data from spring wage negotiations will be available. The ECB is on alert for Data available by June will also provide more insight into the path of underlying inflation and the direction of the labor market, according to Lagarde. ""If these data reveal a sufficient degree of alignment between the path of underlying inflation and our projections, and assuming transmission remains strong, we will be able to move into the dialling back phase of our policy cycle and make policy less restrictive,"" she said. ""But thereafter, domestic price pressures will still be visible. We expect services inflation, for example, to remain elevated for most of this year. So, there will be a period ahead where we need to confirm on an ongoing basis that the incoming data supports our inflation outlook."" Lagarde's message overall was highly positive on the path on inflation, despite flagging geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing domestic price pressures. ""Unlike in the earlier phases of our policy cycle, there are reasons to believe that the expected disinflationary path will continue,"" Lagarde said, stressing confidence in the latest set of The euro zone's central bank has held rates steady since Market attention is now moving to how many rate cuts the ECB is likely to carry out over the course of this year.

"Falling fertility rates are set to spark a transformational demographic shift over the next 25 years, with major implications for the global economy, according to a new study. By 2050, three-quarters of countries are forecast to fall below the population replacement birth rate of 2.1 babies per female, research That would leave 49 countries — primarily in low-income regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia — responsible for the majority of new births. ""Future trends in fertility rates and livebirths will propagate shifts in global population dynamics, driving changes to international relations and a geopolitical environment, and highlighting new challenges in migration and global aid networks,"" the report's authors wrote in their conclusion. By 2100, just six countries are expected to have population-replacing birth rates: The African nations of Chad, Niger and Tonga, the Pacific islands of Samoa and Tonga, and central Asia's Tajikistan. That shifting demographic landscape will have ""profound"" social, economic, environmental and geopolitical impacts, the report's authors said. In particular, shrinking workforces in advanced economies will require significant political and fiscal intervention, even as advances in technology provide some support. ""As the workforce declines, the total size of the economy will tend to decline even if output per worker stays the same. In the absence of liberal migration policies, these nations will face many challenges,"" Dr. Christopher Murray, a lead author of the report and director at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNBC. ""AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics may diminish the economic impact of declining workforces but some sectors such as housing would continue to be strongly affected,"" he added. The report, which was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, did not put a figure on the specific economic impact of the demographic shifts. However, it did highlight a divergence between high-income countries, where birth rates are steadily falling, and low-income countries, where they continue to rise. From 1950 to 2021, the global total fertility rate (TFR) — or average number of babies born to a woman — more than halved, falling from 4.84 to 2.23, as many countries grew wealthier and women had fewer babies. That trend was exacerbated by societal shifts, such as an increase in female workforce participation, and political measures including China's one-child policy. From 2050 to 2100, the total global fertility rate is set to fall further from 1.83 to 1.59. The replacement rate — or number of children a couple would need to have to replace themselves — That comes even as the global population is forecast to grow from 8 billion currently to 9.7 billion by 2050, before peaking at around 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s, Already, many advanced economies have fertility rates well below the replacement rate. By the middle of the century, that category is set to include major economies China and India, with South Korea's birth rate ranking as the lowest globally at 0.82 Meantime, lower-income countries are expected to see their share of new births almost double from 18% in 2021 to 35% by 2100. By the turn of the century, sub-Saharan Africa will account for half of all new births, according to the report. Murray said that this could put poorer countries in a ""stronger position"" to negotiate more ethical and fair migration policies — leverage that could become important as countries grow increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change.

"From consumer and wholesale prices to longer-term public expectations, reports this week served up multiple reminders this week that Data across the board showed pressures increasing at a faster-than-expected pace, causing concern that inflation could be more durable than policymakers had anticipated. The bad news began Monday when Those reports will provide a lot for the Fed to think about when it convenes Tuesday for a two-day policy meeting where it will decide on the current level of interest rates and offer an updated look on where it sees things heading longer term. ""If the data keep rolling in like this, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify a pre-emptive rate cut,"" wrote Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. Taken together, the numbers show ""the great disinflation has stalled and looks to be reversing."" The latest jolt on inflation came Thursday when the Labor Department reported that the Earlier in the week, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said the While surging energy prices contributed substantially to the increase in both inflation figures, there also was evidence of broader pressures from items such as airline fares, used vehicles and beef. In fact, at a time when the focus has shifted to services inflation, goods prices leaped 1.2% in the PPI reading, the biggest increase since August 2023. ""There continue to be signs in PPI data that the disinflation in goods prices is largely coming to an end,"" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark wrote after the report's release. Taken together, the stubbornly high prices appear to have taken their toll on both consumer expectations and behavior. While substantially lower than its mid-2022 peak, inflation has proved resilient despite the Fed's 11 rate hikes totaling 5.25 percentage points and its moves to cut its bond holdings by nearly $1.4 trillion. The New York Fed survey showed that three- and five-year inflation expectations respectively moved up to 2.7% and 2.9%. While such surveys often can be especially sensitive to gas prices, this one showed energy expectations relatively constant and reflected doubt from consumers that the Fed will achieve its 2% mandate anytime soon. On a policy level, that could mean the Fed Along with the surprisingly strong inflation data, consumers are showing signs of letting up on their massive shopping spree over the past few years. Over the past year, sales increased 1.5%, or 1.7 percentage points below the headline inflation rate and 2.3 points below the core rate that excludes food and energy. Investors will get a look at how policymakers feel when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee convenes next week. The FOMC will release both its rate decision — there's virtually no chance of a change in either direction — as well as its revised outlook for longer-term rates, gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment.

Another measure that also excludes trade services rose 0.4%, compared with the 0.6% gain in January, and was above the estimate for a 0.2% advance. On a year-over-year basis, the headline index increased 1.6%, the biggest move since September 2023. The data contributed to a decline on Wall Street, with the major U.S. stock falling slightly. Treasury yields climbed on the back of the report. A busy morning for economic data also showed that retail sales rebounded, up 0.6% on the month, according to Commerce Department data that is adjusted seasonally but not for inflation.

Also, The market focused on the PPI release, which comes two days after the consumer price index, which measures what consumers pay in the marketplace, The PPI is considered a leading indicator for inflation as it indicates costs early in the supply chain. The BLS reported that about two-thirds of the rise in the headline PPI came from a 1.2% surge in goods prices, the biggest increase since August 2023. As with the CPI, the acceleration was traced to energy prices, with saw a 4.4% increase in the final demand measure. Gasoline prices jumped 6.8% at the wholesale level. Services costs increased 0.3%, boosted by a 3.8% surge in traveler accommodation services. On the retail sales side, the data indicated that consumers kept ahead of CPI inflation, which increased 0.4% on the month, though sales were still sluggish. Excluding auto, retail sales rose 0.3%, one-tenth of a percentage point below expectations. Motor vehicle parts and dealers saw an increase of 1.6%, second only to the 2.2% gain for building material and garden centers on the month.

"The European Central Bank must take its time to get interest rate cuts right and will have a clearer picture of inflationary pressures in June, the institution's chief economist told CNBC. ""A lot of evidence is accumulating, but what's also fair to say is that the transition from this holding phase, we've been on hold since last September since a substantial hiking cycle, we do have to take our time to get that right, from holding to dialing back restrictions,"" Philip Lane told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on Thursday. Lane, a Governing Council member, said the euro zone central bank's Inflation In line with the ECB's March messaging, Lane said that more data was required, particularly around wages, and that the Governing Council would ""learn a lot by April, a lot more by June"" — the dates of its next two meetings. In a news conference after the March meeting, ECB President Christine Lagarde said market pricing on the timing of rate cuts — which indicate a start in June as of Thursday — ""seems to be converging better"" with the central bank's view. June emerged as a key date in market commentary, as it's set to mark the first meeting where the ECB can assess spring data on wage negotiations for the year. Asked about other colleagues on the ECB's Governing Council who have suggested rate cuts could take place before the summer, Lane said he believed this was a reference to the second quarter, which would include June. ""I think Q2 is a time when we will be far enough into 2024 to see more of the wage dynamic, to see more of the price pressures."" He stressed that it was important, in his own role, to ""avoid trying to provide calendar guidance to the market."" ""Once we are sufficiently confident that we will get back to target in a sustainable manner, in a timely manner, that's the right time to move to the next phase,"" he said. Policymakers have repeatedly stressed that many of the causes of the inflationary cycle have subsided, such as the energy price spike and supply chain issues. But they remain concerned about domestic inflationary pressures from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey Lane said Thursday that, while the ECB's forecast relied on some moderation in wage growth, it was ""important"" for people's inflation-adjusted salaries to improve, and that companies should shoulder lower profits to allow this to happen. ""Wages were not the source of this inflation problem. But in terms of making sure we get back to target, the interplay between wages and profits, our forecast is built on a degree of wage deceleration,"" he said. ""It's important to say, we need to see workers' real incomes improve, to rebuild, not just this year, [but] the year after. So we allow for higher to normal wage increases."" Lane added, ""But we also need to see, essentially, firms absorbing a fair amount of that in lower profits. Profits were quite high in 2022, there is some room for profits to come down. And that is part of the open questions we have."" ",,2024-04-07,,"European Central Bank chief economist: Must 'take our time' on rate cuts, clearer picture due in June"

"As legal battles over reproductive rights increase across the U.S., one area that could be impacted is egg freezing. In February, the Alabama state Supreme Court ruled that all embryos created through in vitro fertilization Women who choose to undergo reproductive technology procedures such as egg freezing face a long road riddled with obstacles. Here's a look into the driving forces behind egg freezing and the financial, social and emotional costs that come with it — based on personal experiences from women across the country. There's a notion that most women delaying motherhood are doing so to focus on other aspects of their lives, such as their careers. That's not so much the case anymore, according to Marcia Inhorn, a professor specializing in medical anthropology at Yale University. ""The majority of women who freeze their eggs are doing it because they have not found a partner. I call that the mating gap — the lack of eligible, educated, equal partners,"" Inhorn, who last year authored the book ""Motherhood on Ice: The Mating Gap and Why Women Freeze Their Eggs,"" told CNBC. This problem stems from the fact that today, women are receiving higher education at greater rates than men. Inhorn noted that women are outperforming men in higher education in 60% of countries, and that in the United States alone there are 27% more women than men in higher education. ""The result is that, for women who are highly educated in America and of reproductive age — between 20 and 39 — there literally are millions too few college-educated men,"" Inhorn added. Another reason women freeze their eggs is the sense of empowerment the procedure brings them. Fundamentally, Inhorn believes that this freedom that egg freezing allows is what ultimately draws increasingly younger women to the procedure. ""It gives you a little reprieve, a little extra time,"" she said. This statement is one that reproductive endocrinologists and fertility specialists Drs. Nicole Noyes and Aimee Eyvazzadeh agree with. Noyes, who has worked in the fertility industry since 2004 and is based in New York, has seen a noticeable shift in her patients' ages and attitudes in the last two decades. In the beginning, her patients tended to be older, in their early 40s and viewed egg freezing as a last-ditch procedure as they hedged the end of their reproductive lives. Now, women as young as their late 20s come in to see Noyes. Eyvazzadeh, who has also worked in the field for 20 years and lives in California, has noticed a trend towards younger patients who are choosing to freeze their eggs while they're at their most viable. This is the case for social media influencer Serena Kerrigan, who just recently turned 30. Despite being in a relationship, egg freezing was a procedure she willingly undertook while focusing on growing her business, she told CNBC. Kerrigan, who has more than 800,000 followers between her Instagram and TikTok and is based in New York, began sharing her egg freezing journey last year. She wanted to remove some of the stigma around egg freezing and give her followers an inside look at the arduous process. Kerrigan has paid for all her procedures on her own, she told CNBC, and recently partnered with her clinic, Spring Fertility, to donate a round of egg freezing to one of her followers. Eventually, she hopes egg freezing can be less stigmatized. ""There's a layer of shame or taboo that I actually don't understand. To me, this is science, and this is incredible, and this is a huge advancement,"" she said. ""This is a way of putting the power back into women and having control of their lives."" While the benefits of egg freezing are certainly enormous, so too are the associated costs. The average price for a single egg freezing cycle in the U.S. clocks in at Nutrition health coach Jenny Hayes Edwards froze her eggs in 2010 at 34 years old and was But high costs were her number one obstacle. Her restaurants had taken a hit after the 2008 financial collapse, when many consumers began foregoing their expensive ski vacations in Colorado. Hayes Edwards remembers it being a tough decision to make. But her mother eventually helped sway her in favor of the procedure. ""It's just money, and the opportunity that you might be missing is so much bigger,"" Hayes Edwards recalled her mother saying. ""I was so grateful that she pushed me over the edge.""

Hayes Edwards now has a healthy three-year-old daughter, conceived nearly a decade after she froze her eggs, and is still appreciative for the extra time egg freezing bought her to meet her now-husband. In recent years, egg freezing, fertility and family planning services have increasingly Michelle Parsons decided to freeze her eggs since the procedure was offered through her job. The various tech companies Parsons has worked for have offered anywhere between $10,000 to $75,000 in fertility benefits. Parsons, who is a lesbian, had always known that she wanted to freeze her eggs — and undertook the procedure while working at Match Group as chief product officer of dating app Hinge. At the time, neither she nor her ex-partner were ready to have children, but it was one financial incentive Parsons didn't want to miss out on. Besides eggs, Parsons also chose to freeze her successfully fertilized embryos as another backup. Frozen embryos have a much higher likelihood of viable thawing. In fact, Parsons' search for a sperm donor sparked one of the most-used features on the Hinge app — voice prompts. ""When we started to listen to all of these voice recordings of potential sperm donors, the lightbulb went off in my head and I was like, wow, this is what's missing from dating right now,"" Parsons told CNBC. ""Because voice gives you so much nuance into personality, humor, vibe … we ended up building that feature called voice prompts on Hinge and it was a huge, wild success that led to rapid growth for Hinge and it became viral on TikTok."" Still, Parsons noticed egg freezing taking a toll on her professional and personal life in other ways. ""You have to inject yourself with hormones for two weeks. You have to eat differently. You don't really want to be in social settings. You can't drink. There are all these other ramifications around just going through that process, even though we know it'll be for this one month and then it'll be over,"" she said. The process also doesn't guarantee success. Evelyn Gosnell underwent her first egg retrieval when she was 32, following by two additional cycles at 36 and 38 years old. By the time she was ready to have children with her now-partner, the New York-based behavioral scientist had many frozen eggs ready. But, she received no viable and normal embryos after her eggs had been thawed and fertilized.

While the March inflation count represents ""the smallest monthly increase in three months and suggests that the impact of the large minimum wage hike in January may now have largely passed, it is still far from consistent with the single-digit inflation that policymakers are trying to achieve,"" Nicholas Farr, an emerging Europe economist at London-based Capital Economics, wrote in an analyst note Wednesday. ""The latest inflation figures do little to change our view that further monetary tightening lies in store and that a more concerted effort to tighten fiscal policy will be needed too,"" he said. Turkey's central bank implemented eight consecutive interest rate hikes from June 2023 to January 2024, totaling a cumulative 3,650 basis points. It paused in February, suggesting the tightening cycle was over, before raising rates again in March, citing ""deterioration in the inflation outlook"" and saying that ""tight monetary stance will be maintained until a significant and sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed."" Analysts note that with Economic pain and steep living cost increases for ordinary Turks over the last several years played a major role in the results, political observers said.

This was despite declining foreign currency reserves and a rapidly weakening Only after appointing a new finance and central bank team in May 2023 did the central bank stage a turnaround in policy, suggesting greater independence at the bank from the executive branch of Turkey's government.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the rate would hold steady against the previous month at 2.6%. The core rate of inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, cooled from 3.1% to 2.9%, also coming in below expectations. However, inflation in services — a key watcher for the European Central Bank — remained stuck at 4% for a fifth straight month, pointing to continued pressure from wage growth.

"The March nonfarm payrolls count likely will indicate hiring continuing at a solid pace, though some weakening foundations of the labor market could take greater focus when the Labor Department releases its key report Friday morning. Job growth is expected to come in at 200,000 for the period, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast. If that's correct, it will mark a slowdown from Yet a funny thing has been happening with the jobs reports recently: Initially strong numbers have tended to be lowered in subsequent estimates, raising questions about whether the jobs situation is as positive as it looks. That will be just one of several key areas in focus when the report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET. February's release raised eyebrows with a gain that trounced the Wall Street outlook for 198,000 new jobs. Also gaining notice, though, were revisions to the prior two months that reduced December's count by 43,000 to 290,000 and January's by a whopping 124,000 to 229,000. For all of 2023, The trend ""makes me wonder about the credibility of the first number,"" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade Americas. ""So I'll be looking for the revisions from the prior month to see if they're going to be knocked down, and most likely they will be. That's why if you get a big number, take it with a grain of salt."" There is some anticipation on Wall Street of an upside surprise: Goldman Sachs raised its initial forecast to 240,000, an increase of 25,000, following strong Along with numbers, composition is important, namely where the growth is coming from and whether there are any cracks in the employment armor. The job market's resilience has confounded many economists who spent the past two years searching for a jobs-led recession that never happened. ""Firms are seeing strong demand. They've dramatically increased their productivity, and so they're hiring for different kinds of jobs,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. ""That has enabled them to deal with the high-rate environment."" Still, there are areas of concern. Household employment, which counts individual workers rather than total jobs and is used to calculate the unemployment rate, has fallen by nearly 1 million since November. The survey is more volatile and uses a much smaller sample than the establishment count that yields the headline payrolls growth total. But there's no obvious reason for the weakness, though some economists speculate it could involve the surge in illegal immigration over the past few years. Also, Federal Reserve officials will watch all those factors for signs of inflation pressures. Stocks have been under pressure this week as investors worry about the direction of monetary policy. Average hourly earnings are projected to have increased 0.3% in March, which would be a jump from 0.1% in February, though the estimate for the annual gain is 4.1%, or 0.2 percentage point less. If the consensus calls are correct, it's unlikely to move the needle much for the Fed, which is expected to ""Unless there is a wildly positive or outright tragic employment report, they're going to stay on course,"" North said.

"Private sector job growth expanded in March at its fastest pace since July 2023, indicating continuing buoyance in the U.S. labor market, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. Companies added 184,000 workers on the month, an increase from the upwardly revised February gain of 155,000, which also was the Dow Jones estimate for March. In addition to the strong employment pickup, ADP reported that wages for workers who stayed in their jobs increased 5.1% from a year ago, the same rate as February after showing a steady easing going well back into 2023. Those switching jobs saw gains of 10%, also higher than in previous months. ""March was surprising not just for the pay gains, but the sectors that recorded them,"" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. ""Inflation has been cooling, but our data shows pay is heating up in both goods and services."" Job gains were fairly broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality with 63,000. Other sectors showing significant increases included construction (33,000), trade, transportation and utilities (29,000), and education and health services (17,000). Professional and business services saw a loss of 8,000. Services-related industries accounted for 142,000 of the total, with goods providing the rest. ADP, whose survey is based on payroll data analysis of more than 25 million workers, does not track government jobs. Most of the growth came from companies that employ more than 50 workers, with small businesses adding just 16,000 to the total. From a regional standpoint, the South saw the biggest gains, adding 91,000 workers.

"Job creation in March easily topped expectations in a sign of continued acceleration for what has been a bustling and resilient labor market. Nonfarm payrolls increased 303,000 for the month, well above the Dow Jones estimate for a rise of 200,000 and higher than the downwardly revised 270,000 gain in February, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The unemployment rate edged lower to 3.8%, as expected, even though the labor force participation rate moved higher to 62.7%, a gain of 0.2 percentage point from February. A broader measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons held steady at 7.3%. In the key average hourly earnings measure, wages rose 0.3% for the month and 4.1% from a year ago, both in line with Wall Street estimates. Growth came from many of the usual sectors that have powered gains in recent months. Health care led with 72,000, followed by government (71,000), leisure and hospitality (49,000), and construction (39,000). Retail trade contributed 18,000 while the ""other services"" category added 16,000. The February revision was just 5,000 lower while the January revision brought that total up by 27,000 to 256,000, still well below the ""This is another really strong report,"" said Lauren Goodwin, economist and chief market strategist at New York Life Investments. ""This report and the February report showed some broadening in terms of job creation, which is a very good sign.""

Rates for Asians and Hispanics both fell sharply to 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively. A string of positive gains has kept unemployment below 4% since January 2022, though there have been some signs of cracks. For instance the level of household employment had grown only modestly over the past year, while temporary employment has declined sharply. However, the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, posted an even more robust gain in March, up 498,000, more than absorbing the 469,000 increase in the civilian labor force level. Gains tilted heavily to part-time workers in the household survey. Full-time workers fell by 6,000, while part-timers increased by 691,000. Multiple job holders rose by 217,000, to 5.2% of the total employment level. Markets have been keeping close watch over the employment data particularly as the Federal Reserve weighs its next moves on monetary policy. Stocks have tumbled this week amid concerns that a strong labor market and resilient economy could keep the central bank on hold for longer than expected. Stock market futures rose following the report while Treasury yields also added to gains. The Fed is looking to guide inflation back down to 2% annually, a goal that has proven elusive even as the rate of price gains has decelerated from its peak in mid-2022. Most measures have inflation running above 3%, though the Fed's preferred gauge is below that level. Market pricing is pointing toward the first interest rate cut coming in June, though several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, this week indicated they prefer to take a cautious data-dependent approach.

"The U.S. Federal Reserve has become too data dependent and has lost sight of its overall strategy, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said Friday. The economist told CNBC that a longer-term, more strategic outlook could see policymakers settle on a new inflation target of closer to 3%. ""Rather than be strategic, this Fed is overly data dependent, and has turned into a play-by-play commentator,"" El-Erian told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at the Ambrosetti Spring Forum in Italy. ""That's not the role of the Fed,"" he continued. ""The Fed should be strategic, the Fed should provide a strategic anchor, a stabilizer."" ""The mistake that they may make is they'll end up this time being too tight,"" he said. The Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the bank would need A day later, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he wondered if the central bank should El-Erian said the comments were an example of the Fed ""overreacting to data,"" and said that it should take a more holistic view of the economy. However, he noted that policymakers' hawkish approach could be an indication that they are considering the possibility of a new normal inflation target. ""The way you discuss it politely is you don't say 'let's change the inflation target,' you say 'let's get to 2% somewhere in the future. Let's have a trajectory,'"" El-Erian said. ""It may well prove that the economy is stable nearer to 3%. I don't think that's going to de-anchor inflation expectations,"" he added. In an effort to drag inflation back down toward its target, the Fed has hiked interest rates 11 times in total over the last few years to a target range of 5.25%-5.5% — the highest level for more than 22 years. The Fed's goal has proven especially challenging given the high volumes of U.S. banking reserves at present, according to Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. In past monetary tightening cycles, central banks have squeezed bank reserves as an additional means of lowering inflation. But with current U.S. reserves around 1,700 larger than before the 2008 Lehman crisis, according to Koo, that path was unviable. ""If you tried to tighten with this tool, you have to remove the $3.2 trillion first, before you will have any grip on the situation. And of course, you cannot do that overnight,"" Koo said at the same event Thursday.

Based on current understanding, Ellis said there is likely to be about 5 trillion metric tons of geologic hydrogen in Earth's interior, although most of this is likely to be too deep or too far offshore to be economically recovered. Nonetheless, Ellis said that just a few percent of geologic hydrogen recovery might well be enough to supply all projected demand for 200 years. ""The potential is there but we've got to do the work,"" Ellis said via videoconference, adding that more investment is necessary to accelerate early-stage research and development.

The company is considered to be the industry gold standard for communications infrastructure, providing messaging, voice and email solutions to their customers. Twilio went public in But the problem is not solely lack of growth – Twilio is still growing at 8.5% per year. A bigger problem is that despite the level of revenue, even at $4.2 billion, the company has never even come close to being profitable. That is OK for a hyper-growth company. But companies with normal growth must show profitability to attract investors. Part of this problem is the inordinate amount of stock-based compensation Twilio pays: $676 million in 2023 (leading to an operating loss of $877 million). This has partly been the cause of the company's share count doubling since 2017 from approximately 90 million shares to 180 million shares. But there are several signs that the company has been heading in the right direction even prior to Sachem Head's appointment to the board. Stock-based compensation has declined in 2023 by 15.4% from $1.2 billion in 2022. Twilio has substantially reduced its headcount, cutting employees by 18% in the past year from 8,156 in 2022 to 5,867 in 2023. Moreover, Twilio's co-founder and former CEO Jeff Lawson resigned in The primary value creator here will be margin improvement. The company's nearest publicly traded peer Sinch, a smaller and lower quality business built through M&A of even smaller Twilio competitors, has generated positive operating profits and net income for several years with negligible to no stock-based compensation. Twilio should be able to do even better. While the company has demonstrated good intent and is doing a lot of the right things already, there is still plenty of upside potential on further margin expansion and reduction in stock-based compensation. This is a situation where the activist and management are like-minded, which led to a quick and quiet settlement rather than a public proxy fight. On March 30, Sachem Head received a board seat for Andy J. Stafman, partner at Sachem Head, and agreed to withdraw its notice of shareholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election to the board at the 2024 annual meeting. It is always a great activism engagement when the activist goes on the board to help management execute on a plan they all agree on, as opposed to convincing management that the activist's plan is better. We believe Stafman will be a valuable asset to Twilio in overseeing its margin expansion and other plans, but we also expect that he will hold management accountable if they fail to do so. Additionally, we think there is a strong possibility that Twilio gets its top-line growth up as well. Market intelligence and data providers Gartner and IDC still project an industry growth rate in the mid- to high-teens. As the market leader, Twilio should be at the high end of the range. Finally, Sachem Head is not the only activist actively engaged with Twilio.

The first person in the world to be assigned as a CHO was Jane Gilbert, who was appointed in 2021 to oversee Florida's most populous county, Miami-Dade. The CHO role was created by the Atlantic Council's Arsht-Rock Resilience Center, a U.S.-based think tank that aims to support 1 billion people with resilience solutions by 2030. ""We have relatively high [air-conditioning] penetration, but with our rising temperatures, electricity bills are just through the roof. We've also had the electricity rates go up. AC can be over 50% of what the electricity bill so people are choosing between AC and putting food on the table for their families,"" Gilbert told CNBC. A coastal metropolis in the southern U.S., Miami is internationally known for its vulnerability to For six months of the year, Gilbert said temperatures in Miami exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius) almost daily, posing a particularly big problem for To help reduce the risks to the county's population of 2.7 million, Gilbert said her team's action plan focused on informing and preparing people for extreme heat, helping to cool homes affordably and working to cool community neighborhoods to tackle the so-called "" In practice, Gilbert said the measures included broad-scale marketing campaigns targeting the zip codes and demographics known to be most at risk, working with the national weather service and emergency management teams to update advisory and warning levels. They also involved installing 1,700 efficient AC units in public housing and ensuring that new affordable housing requires the most efficient cooling systems, such as cool and solar-ready roofs, to keep utility costs down. ""We want to address the root cause of this problem while we're helping people adapt,"" Gilbert said. ""All of us here have grown up in a typically hot and humid environment. We are used to the heat so that makes it really hard to distinguish between normal heat and unsafe heat,"" Bushra Afreen, CHO for Dhaka North in Bangladesh, told CNBC via videoconference. Afreen, who became Dhaka North's CHO in May last year, said stark income inequality in the country's largest city meant excessive heat was not a universally similar experience. ""When you combine that with fragile urban systems like drainage and power outages and poor health management and poor health systems and poor education systems, you get a very bad stew."" Alongside planting thousands of trees in Dhaka North's informal settlements and reintroducing a culture of water fountains in the city, Afreen said her team would roll out a pilot project in one city settlement to create green nooks and corners for reprieve. Afreen said it would be important to consider the type of trees to plant, such as citrus or neem trees to ward off mosquitoes ""Right now, the two reactions that we're seeing most are 'good job, keep it up, we need more awareness,'"" Afreen said. ""And the other kind is, 'oh, you're going to decrease the heat? Good luck.'"" Tiffany Crawford, co-CHO of Melbourne, told CNBC that extreme heat kills more people in Australia than bushfires, floods and storms. ""There's a reason for that, and it's the lag in the data,"" she said. Crawford, who works alongside Krista Milne as CHOs of Melbourne, said the true scale of heat-related deaths and illnesses often doesn't became clear until health authorities have pored through hospital admissions and ambulance data. With a population of roughly 5 million, the southeastern Australian city of Melbourne is known for its mild and temperate climate — but Crawford says it is prone to spates of summer heatwaves that last for several days and offer scant reprieve through the night. ""There's an extreme northerly wind blows that is just ferocious. I liken it to going outside and it's like someone left the oven door open or the heater on all night and forgot to turn it off,"" Crawford said. Some of the short-term interventions that have been put into place in Melbourne include extending public library and pool hours and rolling out so-called cool kits, which contain water bottles, neck towels and old-fashioned fans. Looking ahead, Crawford said the city was in conversation with Google to provide constituents with so-called online-mapped ""cool routes,"" which help users navigate the city by taking advantage of existing shade or canopy cover. ""In places like Europe, the dialogue in the media is a bit different, the heat is shocking. Whereas in Australia, the heat is something that was consistently lived with, and we will continue to live with it, but it is those variables, like any climate response, they are becoming more and more pronounced,"" Crawford said. ""We need to plan around that."" ",,2024-04-07,,"From Miami to Melbourne, a quiet revolution is underway to fend off a silent and invisible killer"

"Virgin Voyages is targeting a new type of traveler: remote workers. In March, the Miami-based cruise line owned by Sir Richard Branson introduced a month-long cruise called the ""Scarlet Summer Season Pass."" It's essentially four week-long cruises packaged together to appeal to remote workers who want to spend a month at sea in southern Europe. ""People have really adopted the flexible working style, and it resonates with travelers,"" Virgin Voyages' CEO Nirmal Saverimuttu told The Booking the ""Season Pass"" is 30% cheaper than booking four week-long cruises back to back, according to Virgin's website. Travelers can also swap out travel companions for different legs of the cruise, said Saverimuttu, as long as they are 18 or older, in line with Virgin Voyages' Within 24 hours of announcing the Season Pass, more than 2,000 people registered interest in it, said Saverimuttu. When bookings opened, spots on the month-long cruise — which stops at places like Cannes, Rome and Ibiza — sold out in 48 hours, a company representative told CNBC Travel. That prompted Virgin Voyages to open additional spots for remote workers on a second cruise ship this summer. The ""Season Pass"" cruises will sail on Virgin's Scarlet Lady and Resilient Lady ships, each of which can accommodate around 2,700 guests. Cruises are scheduled to sail from June to September this year. The popularity of Virgin's Season Pass cruise stems from the broader shift to remote work since the Covid-19 pandemic. ""We are in the midst of a massive transformation in how, what, and where we do our jobs,"" KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, told CNBC Travel. ""There is no putting the work-from-home genie back in the bottle. Firms who try too aggressively to do so, lose a lot of their access to top talent and the diversity of their workforce."" Saverimuttu said most of the digital workers who have booked the cruise are in their mid-50s and are employed in full-time remote roles. He said the idea for the program came directly from Branson himself, after he learned passengers were taking extended trips while working remotely on the company's ships. He attributed the program's quickly growing popularity to Branson's ""magic touch"" for understanding today's consumers. ""The response has really been phenomenal.

"In this article A car loses value as soon as you drive it off the lot, but electric vehicles are taking this adage to a new level. That's becoming a major barrier to wider adoption, according to some industry and investment experts. A recent While lower used EV prices could increase their desirability to some buyers, they can also reduce demand for new electric vehicles, according to Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. ""The value a new car loses in the first few years is the single most expensive aspect of owning a new vehicle,"" he said, explaining that ""as more new car shoppers become aware of the massive drop in EV values they will be less interested in buying one."" Speaking to CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Monday, David Kuo, stock analyst and co-founder at the Smart Investor, said that the inability of EVs to retain value had kept him from investing in the industry. According to Kuo, EVs are analogous to other consumer electronics like laptops and cell phones in that they tend to lose value and relevance quickly after being sold. ""The same [depreciation] is going to happen to electric vehicles; it'll probably cost you $20,000, $30,000 to buy one, but in a year's time it will depreciate much faster than an internal combustion engine car,"" he said. Industry insiders have also flagged EV resale problems. Kuo further argued that the software and computing capabilities of used EVs may become outdated and incompatible with updates by the time they are sold or even beforehand. That will be a ""lightbulb moment"" when buyers realize they paid too much in the first place, he added. Despite EVs' apparent depreciation issue, its causes might have less to do with the technology itself and more to do with market conditions. According to iSeeCars, dramatic drops in used electric vehicle values in the U.S. have largely been driven by aggressive price cuts by Tesla is the dominant EV seller in the U.S. and as a result of lower prices for its new EVs, buyers are less likely to entertain the same price levels for used alternatives. ""If [Elon Musk] continues to reduce Tesla prices in an effort to stimulate sales, he'll continue to pull the entire market down, as he did over the past 15 months,"" iSeeCars' Brauer said. In an October earnings call, Musk defended the price cuts, emphasizing the importance of cost to consumers. ""It's not an optional thing for most people; it is a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable so people can buy them,"" he said. In the following quarter's earnings call in January, chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said the company would continue to focus on its cost reduction efforts in 2024. Since then, the EV price war between Tesla and Chinese competitors has Additionally, overproduction of EVs relative to demand has created excessive supply, making it unlikely for new and used EV prices to rebound in the near term, according to Brauer. What is an ongoing issue for the EV market, however, may be a boon for electric and combustion powered hybrids, which are showing increasing strength in new and used vehicle markets. The average price for used hybrid vehicles fell only 6.5% or $2,135 last year — a fraction of the decline of the average EV. ""Hybrids are an excellent stepping stone between gasoline and electric cars, and I expect to see them increasing in popularity over the next 10 years,"" Brauer said.

"The widespread arrival of generative artificial intelligence has prompted alarm from many quarters. A But doom is only one interpretation of AI. According to experts paid to predict the future, the arrival of AI is more likely than not to offer a roadmap out of humanity's worst impulses and create a better, more equitable world. That's the rosy scenario outlined in ""We are now at a point in time where science and technology can enable the advancement of humanity in a way we have not seen in a long time,"" said Frank Diana, managing partner and principal futurist at Tata. ""We are in a place we haven't been since the second industrial revolution,"" he said, predicting that AI's widespread arrival will herald innovation in This view is a world away from some prominent tech leaders who have Diana says the doomsday scenarios distract and undermine the technology's potential. ""I think, honestly, the conversation around conscious robots and artificial superintelligence gets in the way,"" Diana said. ""If AI is managed correctly, we will instead talk about all the great things AI can do for humanity."" He said today's often negative view of AI in the popular imagination has roots in the 1970s when Hollywood shifted towards more ominous themes that matched the country's mood. But before that, he said, technology was viewed as something that could one day deliver utopia. Author and futurist Bernard Marr, who was not involved in the Tata survey, echoed the more optimistic thinking. ""I see all the amazing benefits AI can bring and I see it every day. I believe AI is the most powerful technology humans have ever had access to,"" Marr said, a power he believes can be used to bulldoze inequities and challenges in health, education, and climate change. ""We are a very long way from AI becoming sentient, if ever. But AI is very, very good at doing things that in the past only humans could do,"" Marr said. ""The mundane is a waste of our power as humans. AI will allow us to focus on the amazing power that makes us human,"" he added. He sees AI's role evolving into being a constant co-pilot rather than staying awake at night worrying about robots taking over the planet. ""AI will make doctor and patient relationships much better,"" Marr said, describing how the insurance and regulatory paperwork that bogs doctors down now will be taken over by AI, freeing up the practitioner to spend more time with patients. ""I don't see AI as anything scary; all the systems being developed are not working against humans but are making us better."" Given AI's power, regulations, laws, and safeguards are necessary to prevent abuse. ""But already you are starting to see that happen,"" Marr said, referring So why the widespread fear? When people talk about sentient AI, they usually turn immediately to the ominous. Sentient, however, can also be benevolent or values-neutral, but that is not the AI people usually think about. The reason people fear AI lies in our very humanity, said Kelsey Latimer, a Florida-based clinical psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorder. She said that humans are hard-wired to brace themselves for the worst. ""From an evolutionary point of view, we are primed to see the negative and scary things so that we could see the predators coming toward us and respond,"" Latimer said. If we view something as unfavorable and it turns out to be positive, no harm is done. If we view something as positive but it turns out to be negative, then we often need to prepare for the consequences. Futurists like Diana and Marr predict the consequences of AI will be positive ones.

"Israel said on Saturday its special forces had recovered the body of a hostage killed while being held captive in Gaza, as the Palestinian enclave's dominant Islamist movement Hamas said it would take part in a new round of Almost six months into the war, Israel has faced protests at home demanding a deal to free the dwindling number of live hostages from Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border rampage. Western countries, meanwhile, have voiced outrage over what they see as an unacceptably high Palestinian civilian toll and the accompanying humanitarian crisis. The body of Elad Katzir, a 47-year-old Israeli farmer, was unearthed by commandos in southern Khan Younis overnight, the military said. He had been killed by his Palestinian Islamic Jihad captors and buried there in mid-January, it said, citing intelligence information about which it declined to elaborate. Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, had no immediate comment. Katzir was among 253 people dragged into Gaza by Hamas-led gunmen who killed some 1,200 others in southern Israel, according to official tallies, sparking an offensive that medics in the enclave say has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians. His father Avraham was killed in their kibbutz, Nir Oz, and his mother Hanna was also taken hostage but freed in November under a truce. Qatari and Egyptian mediators have been trying to secure another deal that might return some of the 129 remaining hostages in a longer ceasefire in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry on Saturday reported one of the lowest daily death tolls in six months, saying 46 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. The Gaza-based ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants in its reports but local health officials say most of the fatalities have been civilians. Israel says at least a third are fighters. Hamas on Saturday said its fighters targeted three Israeli tanks in Khan Younis with missiles, inflicting casualties. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, though it said earlier that troops had engaged with gunmen in the area. The World Health Organisation said its team had managed to reach Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where Israeli special forces conducted a two-week raid against suspected militants, leaving a wasteland of destroyed buildings. The team saw at least five dead bodies at the complex, most of which had suffered extensive destruction. ""Even restoring minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible,"" said a statement from WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Al-Shifa, the Gaza Strip's biggest hospital before the war, was one of the few healthcare facilities that had been partially operational in the north of enclave before the raid. Angered by an Israeli air strike that killed aid workers in Gaza, U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday urged an ""immediate ceasefire"" and for Israel to boost humanitarian relief measures. Israel approved the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and the temporary use of its Ashdod port following the U.S. criticism, measures welcomed on Saturday by U.N. aid coordinator Jamie McGoldrick. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid told N12's Meet the Press on Saturday that he was travelling to Washington where he will meet U.S. officials next week. The Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether senior officials will meet Lapid. Hamas said it would send a delegation to Cairo on Sunday for a new round of mediated talks. Israel was undecided on whether to attend, an Israeli official said, citing concern that the event would be ""more political theatre than actual progress"". Hamas wants any deal to bring about an end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israel has said that, after any truce, it would topple Hamas, which is sworn to its destruction. A rally in Jerusalem calling on leaders to secure a hostage release was set to take place on Sunday, which marks six months since the Oct. 7 attack, and anti-government protesters in Tel Aviv on Saturday called for an election. In a Jan. 8 video posted by Islamic Jihad online, Katzir said: ""I was close to dying more than once. It's a miracle I'm still alive ... I want to tell my family that I love them very much and I miss them very much."" Based on various sources of information, Israel has declared at least 35 hostages as dead in Gaza captivity. Palestinian factions have said some were killed in Israeli strikes. While confirming this in several cases, Israel says that, in others, hostages whose bodies were recovered bore signs of execution.

"A magnitude 4.8 The earthquake was felt from Boston down to Baltimore at 10:23 a.m. ET, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In New York City, where tremors were felt for more than 30 seconds, there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, but the quake triggered numerous delays and temporary closures of transportation infrastructure in the area. The epicenter of the quake was detected about 45 miles west of New York City, and 40 miles east of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in an area north of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, according to the USGS. Earthquakes of Friday's magnitude are relatively rare in the northeastern U.S., and the intensity and duration of Friday's quake startled people across the region. The quake was the third-largest recorded around the New York metropolitan region in nearly 75 years. ""Everyone @NYSE just gave each other a big look,"" CNBC's Carl Quintanilla tweeted from the New York Stock Exchange in lower Manhattan after the tremors occurred. ""I AM FINE,"" the Empire State Building's social media account X tweeted. The National Tsunami Warning Center said there was no danger of a tsunami on the East Coast after the quake. An aftershock with a 2.0 magnitude occurred at 11:20 a.m. ET in northern New Jersey. The USGS said there was a 46% likelihood of another earthquake of magnitude 3.0 or greater in the next week. The Federal Aviation Administration inspected runways at the three major airports in New York City and Newark, New Jersey. The agency briefly halted departures there, and as of 12:40 p.m. ET, the stop into Newark Liberty International Airport was lifted but flights were delayed about one hour. United Airlines The carrier offered travelers booked to fly the chance to change their Newark, LaGuardia or Philadelphia flights without paying fees or a difference in fare if they can travel as late as next Thursday. New Jersey Transit said its commuter rail service is subject to systemwide delays of up to 20 minutes. The Port Authority for New York and New Jersey, which operates Hudson River crossings, said the Holland Tunnel connecting lower Manhattan to New Jersey was temporarily closed to traffic inspection. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in a tweet said, ""My team is assessing impacts and any damage that may have occurred, and we will update the public throughout the day."" President Joe Biden later Friday said he had spoken to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, ""who thinks everything is under control."" ""He's not too concerned about it,"" Biden said.

"Donald Trump's campaign said it raised $50.5 million on Saturday, a staggering reported haul as his campaign works to catch up to the fundraising juggernaut of President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. The reported haul from the event with major donors at the Palm Beach, Florida, home of billionaire investor John Paulson sets a ""It's clearer than ever that we have the message, the operation, and the money to propel President Trump to victory on November 5,"" his campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement. The event, billed as the ""Inaugural Leadership Dinner,"" sends a signal of a resurgence of Trump and the Republican Party's fundraising, ""This has been some incredible evening before it even starts because people — they wanted to contribute to a cause of making America great again, and that's what's happened,"" Trump said briefly to reporters as he arrived at the event with his wife Melania Trump. Trump and the GOP announced earlier in the week that they raised more than $65.6 million in March and closed out the month with $93.1 million. ""While Donald Trump has been busy awarding himself golf trophies at Mar-a-Lago and palling around with billionaires, Joe Biden has been crisscrossing the nation connecting with voters and outlining his vision to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out,"" Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement, referring to Trump's Florida residence. Campaign fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission detailing donations from Saturday's event are not expected until a mid-July filing date. Trump initially Saturday's high-dollar event hosted about 100 guests, including more than a few billionaires. Contributions to the event will go toward the Trump 47 Committee, according to the invitation, a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee, state Republican parties and Save America, a political action committee that pays the bulk of Trump's legal bills. In an unusual arrangement, the fundraising agreement directs donations to first pay the maximum allowed under law to his campaign and Save America before the RNC or state parties get a cut. Donors who gave the suggested $814,600 per person or $250,000 per person will only have $5,000 of their donation go to Save America, sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cash-strapped RNC. As Trump prepared in March to install a new handpicked leadership team at the RNC, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, some members of the RNC worried that the committee's money would go toward Trump's sizable legal fees as he fights a number of court cases, including four criminal cases. The fundraising arrangement doesn't direct RNC funds to Trump's legal bills. But when checks of any amount are written to the combined campaign, the campaign and Save America get paid first by default. Co-chairs of the fundraiser include Robert Bigelow, a Las Vegas-based businessman who had supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign; New York grocery billionaire John Catsimatidis; Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment executive and head of the Small Business Administration while Trump was president; casino mogul Steve Wynn; and former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to the invitation. Guests were asked to contribute $814,600 per person as a ""chairman"" contributor, which came with seating at Trump's table, or $250,000 per person as a ""host committee"" contributor. Both options come with a photo opportunity and a personalized copy of Trump's coffee table book featuring photographs from his administration, ""Our Journey Together."" Three of Trump's former rivals for the GOP nomination — South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy — were expected to appear as ""special guests."" Hours before the fundraiser, Trump complained on his social media site about the judge in his upcoming New York ""If this Partisan Hack wants to put me in the 'clink' for speaking the open and obvious TRUTH, I will gladly become a Modern Day Nelson Mandela - It will be my GREAT HONOR,"" Trump wrote. In response, Biden campaign official Jasmine Harris said: ""Imagine being so self-centered that you compare yourself to Jesus Christ and Nelson Mandela all within the span of little more than a week: that's Donald Trump for you.""

"A paper mill in a small Mississippi town could help demonstrate whether capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing it deep underground is a viable path to fight climate change. The proposed project at Amazon The Vicksburg paper mill project is just one example of how Carbon capture and storage technology today is expensive, logistically complex and faces controversy over its role in the energy transition and safety concerns in communities where pipeline infrastructure would be expanded. The Paris-based International Energy Agency has described carbon capture and storage as ""critical"" to achieve global net-zero emissions, while also warning the oil and gas industry against using the technology as a way to maintain the status quo on fossil fuels. Some climate activists accuse the industry of simply investing in carbon capture as way to extend the use of oil and gas. The technology typically uses chemical absorption to capture carbon dioxide emitted from the chimney of an industrial plant. The emissions are condensed into a fluid for transport, normally through a pipeline, and are stored thousands of feet below ground in depleted oil wells or geological formations such as saltwater reservoirs. The challenges to implementing the technology are immense. The world needs to capture more than 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030, more than 20 times the 45 million metric tons captured in 2022, according to the IEA. By 2050, the amount of carbon that's captured needs to reach 6 billion tons — more than 130 times the 2022 level, according to the agency. But the track record of carbon capture and storage so far has been one of ""underperformance,"" with only 5% of announced projects having reached a final investment decision, according to the IEA. The industry needs to demonstrate that the technology can operate economically at scale after struggling to ramp up deployment for years, the agency says. The Vicksburg papermill project is still in an early development stage. SLB is confident that it will prove technologically viable, said Fred Majkut, senior vice president of carbon solutions at the company. The goal is to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is also economically viable, Majkut said. ""The economic viability of carbon capture and sequestration is a challenge today because the cost of building most plants in order to capture carbon dioxide are very significant,"" the executive said. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit an industrial plant, he said. For International Paper, the Vicksburg project is a potential way to produce lower carbon products for consumers who are climate conscious and a potential opportunity to benefit financially through the sale of carbon credits. ""There are examples in the marketplace where customers have the opportunity to express their preferences economically, whether that's clicking a button to say they want to abate the carbon emissions for a trip in an Uber or an airplane,"" said Adam Miklos, director of low carbon innovation at International Paper. ""Ultimately, it has the potential to reduce our emissions and, if successful, present an opportunity to sell carbon and renewable credits,"" Miklos said. The Mississippi mill is a snapshot of how the oil and gas industry is trying to demonstrate that carbon capture and storage is a viable tool in the race to slash emissions, after using similar technology for decades to extract oil. The industry has used carbon storage techniques since the 1970s in a process called enhanced oil recovery, in which carbon dioxide is injected underground to create pressure that pushes more crude toward production wells. Chevron Total spending on carbon capture and storage projects is expected to reach $241 billion worldwide by 2030 if all announced projects materialize, according Rystad Energy. The United States and the United Kingdom are the leaders, with investments expected to reach $85 billion and $45 billion, respectively, by the end of the decade, according to Rystad. In the U.S., investment in carbon management technologies more than doubled to $1.2 billion in 2023, the first full year after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, according to the Cement plants, for example, produce emissions not only by burning fossil fuels, but also due to the materials used in the manufacturing process. About two-thirds of the industry's carbon dioxide emissions come from chemical reactions that occur when breaking down limestone. Cement is one of the most widely-used products globally, second only to drinking water, and is responsible for about 7% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions alone, ""Right now, these types of industries have no way to effectively decarbonize to net zero without carbon capture,"" Majkut said. ""If they want to produce cement, there will be CO2 emissions simply because of the materials that are being used."" With carbon storage already a mature commercial business, SLB is trying to tackle the capture side, which presents one of the major hurdles to scaling up the technology due to its high cost, according to Majkut. The solvent that would be used to catch carbon dioxide molecules at the Mississippi mill promises to lower the energy requirements of the capture process and make it more cost effective, he said. ""We're quite comfortable that in the next 12 to 24 months, we will be coming to market with actually that chemistry as part of our core offering and develop what we call process design packages,"" Majkut said. SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch has said carbon capture and storage will play a leading role in the company's annual revenue targets of $3 billion by 2030 and $10 billion by 2040 for its new energy portfolio. SLB this month announced a nearly $400 million investment in Aker Carbon Capture, a pure-play carbon capture company based in Norway, in an effort to accelerate deployment of the technology at commercial scale. Competitor Baker Hughes is developing direct air capture technology after acquiring a company called Mosaic Materials in 2022. Baker Hughes has not disclosed the value of the deal. The technology aims to catch low concentration carbon dioxide emissions, which are harder to capture, directly from the atmosphere as well as from industrial plants. Baker Hughes anticipates the technology will most likely come to market by the end of 2026. Baker Hughes is targeting up to $7 billion in orders by 2030 for its new energy portfolio, which includes carbon capture and storage technology. The company is forecasting a total market for its new energy business of between $60 billion and $70 billion by the end of the decade. ""By 2030, I do believe we're going to start to see these technologies start to become reasonably competitive,"" said Alessandro Bresciani, senior vice president of climate technologies at Baker Hughes. The Gulf Coast of the United States, home to enormous oil and gas and other industrial plants, is emerging as a center of carbon capture and storage investments in the U.S. Jeff Gustavson, vice president of lower carbon energies at Chevron, said the region has the potential to quickly increase use of the technology because of favorable geology for storage located close to high concentration emissions that are easier to capture at a lower cost. Some 100 million tons of carbon dioxide are emitted annually from Houston through to Port Arthur, Texas, Gustavson said. Chevron Exxon over the past two years has entered agreements to capture carbon emissions from ammonia and fertilizer producer Dan Ammann, president of low carbon solutions at Exxon, said those three contracts combined promise to remove 5 million tons of emissions annually — the equivalent of converting 2 million gas-powered cars to electric vehicles. Exxon completed its acquisition of the carbon-dioxide pipeline operator Denbury for $5 billion in late 2023. The deal gave Exxon more than 900 miles of pipeline stretching through Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas that are located near at least 10 storage sites in the region. ""It gives us sort of instantaneous scale, instantaneous reach, across this huge source of emissions along the Gulf Coast,"" Ammann said of the Denbury acquisition. ""It gives us the ability to develop storage all along that pipeline as well."" Exxon says it now owns the largest carbon dioxide pipeline network in the U.S. As the infrastructure comes together, Exxon is seeing ""a very high level of interest from a lot of different emitters along the Gulf Coast,"" Ammann said. Chevron is the operator and lead investor in a flagship project called Bayou Bend, which has a 140,000 acre position of permanent carbon dioxide storage space near Port Arthur and Beaumont, Texas. The project is a joint venture with minority shareholders Negotiations are currently underway with potential customers, Gustavson said, declining to disclose names. The area is home to large petrochemical, refinery, liquid natural gas and industrial gas operations with significant carbon dioxide footprints, he said. ""Bayou Bend could be one of the largest CO2 storage projects in the world. You're talking several million tons a year of storage,"" Gustavson said. The project has the potential for even more storage capacity depending on how much technical progress is made, the executive said. While the IEA has described carbon capture and storage as ""essential"" to slash emissions in sectors like heavy industry, agency director Fatih Birol issued a sharply worded statement in November calling on the oil and gas industry to let go of the ""illusion that implausibly large amounts of carbon capture are the solution"" to climate change. Birol's comments came on the back of an ""We're not saying carbon capture can be implemented everywhere,"" SLB's Majkut said. ""As a matter of fact, the primary way to decarbonize should be energy efficiency, scale up of renewables, and effectively carbon capture shall be used on applications that you can't easily electrify, that you can't easily decarbonize otherwise."" Increasing carbon capture and storage to meet net-zero emissions goals in the U.S. will require a massive expansion of pipeline infrastructure. The Department of Energy ""The key is the right geology close by to concentrated emissions,"" Gustavson said. ""That's where we see this scaling fastest first, but over time, we will need to build more CO2 infrastructure to be able to transport CO2 much longer distances to access the same storage."" But the permitting process is challenging because pipelines often cross state lines, requiring lengthy approval from multiple jurisdictions and creating bottlenecks, Majkut said. Pipeline expansion has faced opposition in communities where residents are Denbury said in a The Energy Department says carbon dioxide pipelines have a better safety record than natural gas pipelines and other large infrastructure such as electric transmission. There have been no deaths from carbon dioxide pipelines over the past two decades and one injury in addition to the hospitalizations from the Satartia incident, according to the Transportation Department. There are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding carbon capture and storage, said Miklos, the executive at International Paper. But the Vicksburg project is an opportunity to carefully examine the technical and economic viability and the impact on climate over a multiyear period, he said. ""The primary questions are around the ability to do this in a way that is cost effective,"" he said.
